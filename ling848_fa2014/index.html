<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

There are no formal prerequisites, but this is an advanced computational linguistics seminar, so students are expected to be generally comfortable with the material covered in the CMSC/Ling 723-773 graduate computational linguistics sequence.  


<h2>Description</h2>

<font color="red">Note: The content of 800-level seminars varies from
year to year, and this seminar will <strong>not</strong> cover the
same material as previous offerings of Ling848 (Seminar in
Computational Linguistics).  If you have questions about the seminar, including any
uncertainty about whether your background is appropriate in order to
attend, please contact me.</font>

<P>
Within computational linguistics, semantics has a long and varied history.  As a branch of artificial intelligence, early natural language processing was, like early AI, deeply concerned with how to formally represent and reason about knowledge.  With the statistical revolution in the 1990s such questions largely went out of fashion, but now they are back in new  incarnations, with fascinating work taking place that brings together earlier work on formal representations with a current emphasis on what can be learned automatically using large volumes of data.

<P>
The goals of this seminar are twofold: to understand the big picture of semantics in computational linguistics, and to get a detailed understanding of the issues at play in specific instances of recent research.  By the end of the semester students should be well equipped to understand and follow current research literature on this topic.

<P>
The seminar will mainly involve readings and in-class discussion,
helped along by participation in <a
 href="https://piazza.com/umd/fall2014/ling848/home">discussions on
Piazza</a>.  The class will be graded on:
<ul>
<li> Participation (25%), which includes both leading class
 discussions and demonstrating, through discussion, that you have done readings thoroughly and thoughtfully;
 <P>
<li> Two or three short papers during the semester, which will mainly
 involve doing some readings on topics we don't discuss in class and
 generating summaries/commentaries (15%); and, primarily,
 <P>
<li> A term paper/project (60%).  I always to encourage hands-on
 projects that involve real problems, aiming for papers suitable for
 submission to appropriate conferences.  This means I am very open to
 projects that are connected to students' own research.  That said,
 however, a key criterion for a good project is, <em>does this project
 connect well to the content of the seminar, and demonstrate that the
 student understands the topic better than he or she did at the
 beginning of the semester?</em>
 <P>
</ul>
