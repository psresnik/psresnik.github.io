<h2>The fine print</h2>

The following are general statements of policy.

<h3>Syllabus can change</h3>

This syllabus is subject to change. Students will be notified in advance of important 
changes that could affect grading, assignments, etc.

<h3>Attendance and absences</h3>

Students are expected to come to class.  If you have any significant
medically necessary absences, there is an expectation that you will
let the instructor know in advance.
<P>
Prolonged absence or illness preventing attendance from class requires written 
documentation from the Health Center and/or health care provider verifying dates of 
treatment when student was unable to meet academic responsibilities.
<P>
Absence due to religious observance will not be penalized, however, it is the studentâ€™s 
responsibility to notify the instructor within the first 3 weeks of class regarding any 
religious observance absence(s) for the entire semester. The calendar of religious 
holidays can be found at: http://faculty.umd.edu/teach/attend_student.html#religious

<h3>Academic integrity</h3>

The student-administered Honor Code and Honor Pledge prohibit 
students from cheating on exams, plagiarizing papers, submitting the same paper for 
credit in two courses without authorization, buying papers, submitting fraudulent 
documents and forging signatures. On every examination, paper or other academic 
exercise not specifically exempted by the instructor, students must write by hand and sign 
the following pledge:

<blockquote>
I pledge on my honor that I have not given or received any unauthorized 
assistance on this examination (or assignment).
</blockquote>

Allegations of academic dishonesty will be reported directly to the Student Honor 
Council: http://www.shc.umd.edu . 

<h3>Students with disabilities</h3>

The University of Maryland is committed to providing 
appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities. Students with a documented 
disability should inform the instructors within the add-drop period if academic 
accommodations are needed. To obtain an Accommodation Letter prepared by Disability 
Support Service (DSS), a division of the University Counseling Center, please call 
301-314-7682, e-mail dissup@umd.edu, or visit the Shoemaker Building for more 
information. 

<h3>Copyright notice</h3>

Class lectures and other materials are copyrighted and they may not 
be reproduced for anything other than personal use without written permission from the 
instructor.

<h3>Emergency protocol</h3>

If the university is closed for an extended period of time, see the class discussion list for information on how the course will be continued.

<h3>Course evaluations</h3>

Course evaluations are a part of the process by which the University of Maryland seeks to 
improve teaching and learning. Your participation in this official system is critical to the 
success of the process, and all information submitted to CourseEvalUM is confidential. 
(Instructors can only view group summaries of evaluations and cannot identify which 
submissions belong to which students.)

<h3>Diversity</h3>

The University of Maryland values the diversity of its student body. 
Along with the University, I am committed to providing a classroom atmosphere that 
encourages the equitable participation of all students regardless of age, disability, 
ethnicity, gender, national origin, race, religion, or sexual orientation. Potential 
devaluation of students in the classroom that can occur by reference to demeaning 
stereotypes of any group and/or overlooking the contributions of a particular group to the 
topic under discussion is inappropriate. (See Statement on Classroom Climate, http://
www.umd.edu/catalog/index.cfm/show/content.section/c/27/ss/1584/s/1541).

<h3>Other notes or policies</h3> 

Students are welcome to eat or drink in class.  
<P>
Everyone is welcome to use laptops or other electronic devices <em>in
connection with the class</em>, e.g. looking up relevant references or
information.  Please do <em>not</em> check e-mail or do other
non-class activities while in class.
