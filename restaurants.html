<h1>Restaurants for visitors in College Park</h1>

Well, culinarily speaking it may be that the best thing about College Park is its proximity to DC and some good restaurants in the corridor from University Blvd in College Park over to Wheaton. However, here are some suggestions and comments as of January 2018 for places not too far away.

<p>On campus or close walking distance
<ul>
<p><li> Board and Brew. Short walk from UMIACS with surprisingly good {service, coffee, food, atmosphere, wifi}.
<p><li> Kapnos Taverna. Short walk from either UMIACS or Linguistics and reliably tasty.
<p><li> Adele's Restaurant (Stamp Union). Food is mediocre and it's a solid has-tablecloths place for official visitors.
<p><li> Looney's Pub. Student pub a short walk from UMIACS, food not bad. A bit noisy.
<p><li> Jason's Deli. Short walk from Linguistics, food not bad. 
<p><li> Arroy. Thai. Jordan's favorite College Park restaurant.
</ul>


<p> Unexpected entry if you're coming to campus from the Beltway
<ul>
<p><li>  The cafeteria at Ikea. Really good food (Swedish meatballs, yum!). But avoid the salads.
</ul>

South of campus (not walking distance)
<ul>
<p><li> Franklin's. Nice atmosphere, good food, craft beers, and neat little knicknacks shop. Definitely good for visitors.
<p><li> Busboys and Poets. Very nice atmosphere, good food. Definitely good for visitors.
</ul>
