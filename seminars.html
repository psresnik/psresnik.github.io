 - Choosing presentations.  I put the list of presentations up on a
   blackboard and let the students pair up and sign up during a class
   break during the first class meeting.  The pairing up was really
   effective, both for distributing the workload and for helping get
   leverage from different students' strengths and weaknesses.  And by
   taking myself out of the loop, I gave the class the opportunity to
   do whatever haggling/negotiating they needed to figure out who
   would do what.  It worked pretty well.  It was also interesting to
   see whichs students chose things that played to their existing
   strengths, and which ones preferred to jump into something
   completely new.

 - What to focus on.  I found that it was good to encourage the
   students to talk with me after they'd done the reading, but before
   they had prepared the presentation, so we could discuss what the
   "take home messages" of the presentation should be.  Usually I have
   more of a big picture than the students do of how a particular
   presentation fits into the flow of the course.  Often a ten minute
   discussion was all this required.

 - Level of detail.  Related to the previous point, students also tend
   to appreciate guidance on how deeply they should go into technical
   details, versus details of experimentation, versus connecting the
   paper to related work.  The answer depends on the students, the
   class, and the paper.  For my advanced NLP seminar we had some
   technically very dense material and I found it was really helpful
   for the presenters to "become the expert" and walk the class
   through the difficult bits (with my help, perhaps, in identifying
   which bits were ok to gloss over).

 - Use of the readings.  I tend to assign a central paper or two, but
   also to provide pointers to other resources -- especially Web
   tutorials -- as optional readings.  Often the best way to really
   understand something is to triangulate from several different
   presentations of the same ideas.  But you can't require too much at
   once.  So a good middle ground is to require a central reading or
   maybe two, but then encourage the presenters to also make sure
   they've read the most relevant *optional* readings.  Again, the
   presenters become the experts.

 - Advance discussion.  We had a class mailing list, and class
   participation was part of the grade, so I was pretty successful at
   getting students to read in advance, ask questions of each other,
   and help each other to figure out the answers.  One thing that
   helped with this was to require some kind of reaction to be posted
   to the list reasonably far in advance of class, to make sure they
   didn't wait until hours before class to do the reading.

 - Strategic interruptions.  During the student presentations, I
   tended to interrupt at strategic points both to make sure the class
   (including me!)  was following the details, as well as drawing
   high-level connections for them that weren't in the readings.
   Making big-picture connections, e.g. related to the history of the
   field, or relating theoretical work with applications, etc., is
   something that the students really seem to like.  

 - Early survey.  About a third of the way through the semester in any
   course I teach, I generally do a survey to get early feedback.  For
   example, I generally include questions about how many hours per
   week are being spent on readings and assignments, whether I'm
   interrupting too much, whether we're covering too much or too
   little in each class meeting, etc.  In my advanced NLP seminar this
   was really useful because I discovered I'd miscalibrated and the
   workload (namely time needed for readings) was a bit higher than
   I'd intended.

So... those are some thoughts.  I hope this helps!
