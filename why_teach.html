I doubt you remember me.  I took your NLP class over a year ago.  But I
was just going over my transcript and I wanted to say thanks.  Your
class had nothing to do with my research, so it wasn't really applicable
to the rest of my PhD career.  But it was cool.  Damned cool.  And I
learned a lot of things that just made me feel more scholarly.  Often
times now, I'll hear a sentence and think about how it could be parsed. 
And being fluent in German, I also find myself thinking about
cross-language issues.  Your course just opened a lot of doors and gave
me a lot of things to think about.  So thanks again.

A while ago, you recommended reading Taylor's 1962 paper on the
process of asking questions, and I just wanted to send a note of
gratitude/appreciation since it has helped frame a lot of my thinking
and work since around the robustness of modern day QA systems. It has
especially helped me start to write one of the papers I'm working on
now around characterizing poorly posed questions.

It is sometimes difficult to step out of how most folks in the
community are thinking about a particular topic or problem, and so I
just wanted to say thank you for all the perspective and insight you
bring, especially when you draw unexpected connections that sometimes
become very fundamental and eye-opening, and help renew my excitement
in what I'm working on.

From <strong>The Chicago Handbook for Teachers: A Practical Guide to
the College Classroom</strong>, by Alan Brinkley, Betty Dessants,
Michael Flamm, Ctnthia Fleming, Charls Forcey and Eric Rothschild. The

<em>Afterward pp. 169-170.</em><P>

This book has attempted to answer a number of questions about how to 
teach, on the assumption that its readers are people with enough 
commitment to the academic life to want to teach well.  But almost 
all teachers ask themselves at some point - even at many points - the 
question not of how to teach but why.  That is a question every 
teacher must answer, in some measure, alone.  But we offer a few 
observations, drawn from our own experiences, on this central issue 
of academic life.<P>

One of the realities of teaching, of course, is that the people who 
benefit the most from what we do - our students - disappear from our 
lives quickly and usually permanently the moment they graduate (if 
not before) and give us few opportunities to see how we have affected 
them. And yet nothing is clearer from the long history of education 
than that good teachers - like good parents - play an enormously 
important role in the lives of many of their students; that they do, 
in fact, change students' lives. One of the rewards of good teaching, 
therefore, should be the knowledge that we have instilled modes of 
thinking, created intellectual passions, promoted forms of tolerance 
and understanding, and, of course, increased knowledge.<P>

Teaching has rewards to teachers themselves as well.  The community 
of education and scholarship can be a lonely place at times, and can 
seem isolated fro the larger world.  But the academic life at its 
best is also a broadening life - a life of constant surprises and 
continuing intellectual growth; a life that forever expands our 
knowledge of the world and hence the richness of our experience in 
living out our lives; a life that gives us opportunity to convey our 
own passion for what we know to others in the hope that some of them, 
at least, will come to share it.  The wonder and excitement that we 
sometimes encounter in our students when we help them discover a new 
area of knowledge is rewarding to us, in part, because it helps us 
recapture that same wonder and excitement, which is continually with 
our grasp if we do not lose the will to find it. <P>

Good teaching, finally is valuable to society - in ways both obvious 
and obscure. Everyone agrees that education is important, and that 
effective teaching is the key to education.  Students need many 
skills and much knowledge to succeed in today's rapidly changing 
world; there is a direct correlation between a person's level of 
education and his or her chances of professional and economic success 
in life.  But education has another, less immediately visible, social 
value.  It is a vehicle for creating knowledgeable, aware citizens 
who are capable of looking critically at the world in whey they live 
and making informed decisions about their lives and the lives of 
others.  Education is a way of keeping alive the true basis of 
democracy: the ability of people to know enough and understand enough 
about the great issues of their time to help guide their society into 
its future.  In the discouraging moments that all teachers encounter 
from time to time, it is worth remembering this great goal - which, 
when things go well, also becomes the great achievement - of devoting 
one's life to education.<P>
