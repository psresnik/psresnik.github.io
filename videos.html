        abstract: `In computational social science research, we often look at what people say when what we're really interested in is what they think. In linguistics we distinguish between the conventional meaning (semantics) of an utterance and its interpretation (contextualized meaning), which takes into account presuppositions and other unstated aspects of the thought behind the content. Similarly in political communication we talk about framing,  distinguishing between what is said and the implications behind how it is said. In this talk I discuss recent research that bridges this gap by using large language models to make plausible inferences about the unstated content behind what people say. Surfacing this kind of latent content as natural language, rather than some other representation, makes it possible to apply the full arsenal of natural language processing techniques to what people mean rather than just what they say. We have found in several studies that this approach is valuable in making sense of public opinion, analyzing legislator voting behavior, and in going beyond the pro/con/neutral of conventional stance detection to extract both implicit and explicit attitudes and place them on a continuous scale, enabling more effective analysis of issue attitudes in online communities.

        abstract: `Prediction plays an essential role in language processing. In psycholinguistics we tend to interpret that sentence pretty narrowly -- what word are we expecting next? In this talk, I argue that we should be interpreting it more broadly. What we think of as prediction has a role to play not only in basic research on language processing, but also in characterizing social phenomena at the level of individuals and communities. I'll argue for a general characterization of prediction, and discuss the way it applies not only to the usual questions we ask in sentence processing but also to societally relevant issues like political communication and mental health, a perspective that makes the things we think about in psycholinguistics more directly relevant as we seek to understand and affect what's happening in the world around us.`,

        "abstract": "[I'm a co-author. Talk by lead author Chau Minh Pham.] Topic modeling is a well-established technique for exploring text corpora. Conventional topic models (e.g., LDA) represent topics as bags of words that often require \"reading the tea leaves\" to interpret; additionally, they offer users minimal control over the formatting and specificity of resulting topics. To tackle these issues, we introduce TopicGPT, a prompt-based framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to uncover latent topics in a text collection. TopicGPT produces topics that align better with human categorizations compared to competing methods: it achieves a harmonic mean purity of 0.74 against human-annotated Wikipedia topics compared to 0.64 for the strongest baseline. Its topics are also more interpretable, dispensing with ambiguous bags of words in favor of topics with natural language labels and associated free-form descriptions. Moreover, the framework is highly adaptable, allowing users to specify constraints and modify topics without the need for model retraining. By streamlining access to high-quality and interpretable topics, TopicGPT represents a compelling, human-centered approach to topic modeling.",

Inspired by this observation, we introduce a method for the analysis of text that takes implicitly communicated content explicitly into account. We use a large language model to produce sets of propositions that are inferentially related to the text that has been observed, then validate the plausibility of the generated content via human judgments. Incorporating these explicit representations of implicit content proves useful in multiple problem settings that involve the human interpretation of utterances: assessing the similarity of arguments, making sense of a body of opinion data, and modeling legislative behavior. Our results suggest that modeling the meanings behind observed language, rather than the literal text alone, is a valuable direction for NLP and particularly its applications to social science.",

Method developers have staked the efficacy of new topic model variants on automated measures, and their failure to approximate human preferences places these models on uncertain ground. Moreover, existing evaluation paradigms are often divorced from real-world use. Motivated by content analysis as a dominant real-world use case for topic modeling, we analyze two related aspects of topic models that affect their effectiveness and trustworthiness in practice for that purpose: the stability of their estimates and the extent to which the model's discovered categories align with human-determined categories in the data. We find that neural topic models fare worse in both respects compared to an established classical method. We take a step toward addressing both issues in tandem by demonstrating that a straightforward ensembling method can reliably outperform the members of the ensemble.",

We introduce a general approach to these tasks motivated by syntopical reading, a reading process that emphasizes comparing and contrasting viewpoints in order to improve topic understanding. To capture collection-level context, we introduce the syntopical graph, a data structure for linking claims within a collection. A syntopical graph is a typed multi-graph where nodes represent claims and edges represent different possible pairwise relationships, such as entailment, paraphrase, or support. Experiments applying syntopical graphs to the problems of detecting stance and aspects demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in each domain, significantly outperforming approaches that do not utilize collection-level information.",

In this paper, we extend the surprisal approach to use broader topical context, investigating the influence of local and topical context on processing via an analysis of fMRI time courses collected during naturalistic listening. Lexical surprisal calculated from ngram and LSTM language models is used to capture effects of local context; to capture the effects of broader context a new metric based on topic models, topical surprisal, is introduced. We identify distinct patterns of neural activation for lexical surprisal and topical surprisal.",

Where previous work on text segmentation considers the tasks of document segmentation and segment labeling separately, we show that the tasks contain complementary information and are best addressed jointly. We introduce Segment Pooling LSTM (S-LSTM), which is capable of jointly segmenting a document and labeling segments. In support of joint training, we develop a method for teaching the model to recover from errors by aligning the predicted and ground truth segments. We show that S-LSTM reduces segmentation error by 30% on average, while also improving segment labeling.",

The toll that mental illness takes worldwide is enormous, and in the U.S. in 2016 suicide became the second leading cause of death among those aged 10-34 and the fourth among those aged 35-54. Compounding these existing problems is an 'echo pandemic' in the wake of COVID-19, as people have struggled with isolation, stress, and sustained disruptions of day to day life. In this session, we will talk about opportunities and challenges in applying natural language processing and machine learning approaches to assess suicide risk and in computational research on mental health more generally. This will include advocating for a shift in emphasis from binary classification to prioritization under limited-resource constraints and a discussion of secure data enclaves as a practical way to make technological collaborations possible with sensitive data."

About a third of young adults between the ages of 17 and 24 cannot qualify for military service because they are overweight or obese.  And a country struggling to meet its internal healthcare challenges is a country with less attention to spend on its relationships with the rest of the world. The ability to analyze large quantities of data is fostering dramatic progress in a multitude of research areas.  Healthcare research should be a prime candidate for big data analysis, with the potential for triangulating among the language of clinical narratives, structured data in medical records,  and behavioral data in social media. But research in this area is severely hampered by lack of researcher access to data they badly need.  In this presentation I will lay out the problem, talk about the kinds of research that should be possible, and discuss some potential solutions."
