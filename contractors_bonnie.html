[I have used all of these companies in the last 3 years, and
4 of them in the last month.]

I. Moving Companies

There is ONLY ONE company that anyone in Maryland should choose.  It
is the Short-Hop Moving Company, Laurel, 20707 - 301-497-1790.  They
are GOOD GOOD GOOD.  They take tremendous care of everything you own.
Their workers are clean cut, curteous, and diligent.  They are the
most competitively priced in the area. They moved a colonial home
recently for $450 (and have now given me an estimate of $550 on
mine---I have 60 boxes beyond my furniture).  The $450 job took 2
hours.  They are expecting to take 1 hour to pack up the $550 job (and
30 minutes to unload).  Unlike most other companies, these guys give
a guaranteed estimate.

Use these guys.  You will be VERY happy.  We are using them THREE TIMES
this summer.

II. HEATING AND AIR CONDITIONING:

Aire-Flo Heating and A.C. --- These guys are really good; curteous,
punctual, and reasonable.  Three years ago they fixed what B&B said
was a $1200 job (see below) for $85; They simply repaired a very small
leak and said it wasn't necessary to replace the whole unit.  It's
been functioning perfectly for 3 years now.  They guarantee their work
and have various reasonable maintenance plans.  Full information:

Aire-Flo Heating and A.C.
Beltsville Heating & A.C. Inc.
11610 Baltimore Ave.
Beltsville MD 20705
Phone: 301-937-6700 (Metro DC)
       410-792-7288 (Baltimore)
       202-484-5810 (DC)
       301-725-9333 (Columbia)

DO NOT GO WITH B&B Air Conditioning and Heating Service (They are in
Rockville/Belltsville/Laurel/Gaithersburg/Columbia).  The gave me an
estimate once (for $60) on a malfunctioning air conditioner.  The
estimate was $1200 for a new system; they would not repair a small
link.  Even worse: They broke a capacitor while they were checking out
the unit AND they turned off my airconditioning permanently, in the
heat of summer, without telling me.  (I couldn't get them to come back
for 7 days, during which my house turned into an attic.)  I made them
come back, fix it for free, and give me a refund.  They did that, but
treated me like dirt during all their visits. (They told me I was
making the wrong choice by not paying them $1200, bombarded me with
"horror stories" about how I would end up ruining my system if I
didn't pay them, walked away in a huff twice, etc.).

If you decide you want to go with these guys anyhow (!), here's there
information:

301-937-0404 (Laurel)

III. TERMITES

Century Termite Control
301-840-9282

I was happy with these guys.  They got rid of my termites 2 years ago
and guaranteed treatment through 5 years; also, unlimited pest control
each year (including bees, ants, crickets, etc.).  Their rates seem
high, but I think it was worth it!  Preventive Ground rod: $100 (Total

rod: No drilling; full spray along foundation (annual exterior
treatment). 1 hour for treatment; can stay in house.

attached to home is covered.

control a fee of $45 will be charged.

They provide a price protection guarantee: If you find a company that
will give you all services listed above at a lower price, century
termite control will give a one year warranty free of charge.

IV. Painting

I liked Polyzos Painting.  They're a family operation.  They covered a
large portion of my interior walls (1 MBR, 2 baths, hallway, stairway,
foyer, DR, LR, FR) for $1150.  They used two coats and it looked very
good afterwards.  I had to keep an eye on them, though; they were a
little sloppy in places (painting onto some wood accidentally and also
some drips), but I was happy when they were done.  They moved all the
furniture around.  They also repaired some stains on the ceiling (from
water) and, of course, some holes in the wall (which everyone always
has).

Information:

Polyzos Painting, Inc.
11815 New Hampshire Ave
Silver Spring, MD 20904

V. Carpeting

If you are looking to get a LOT of carpet for a LITTLE price (but you
gotta watch these guys too!), check out Mattress & Carpet Outlet,
13491 Baltimore Ave Laurel, MD 20707 (301)-210-1500.  They did my
whole house for $2461 (FR, LR, DR, stairs, halls, 3 BRs) including a
fairly nice berber rug.  They also recently did a friend's home (LR,
DR, FR, 2 sets of stairs, 3 BRs) for $1900 including a berber rug.
They had to be called back to fix a few niggly things (nailing down)
later, but they did so quickly and the job was nice when it was
complete.

VI. Carpet Shampooing

Monique Jezierski of TLC Carpet Cleaning charged me $175 for doing 7
rooms, 2 hallways, and 2 sets of stairs.  She spent 4 hours on the
job, used a special solution, and was on her hands and knees for some
of the toughest stains (e.g., rust) that I had ever seen in my life.
She is easy-going, careful, and extremely competitively priced.  She's
a freelance cleaner, so her hours are very flexible.  Call Monique at
301-474-9229.

More comments: Blinds.
<PRE>
We just had our home blinds installed by Sam Kugler, Kugler's Home
Fashions, 20 University Blvd E., Silver Spring, MD 20901, 301-593-8905
www.kuglers.com, skugler@aol.com.  They are right in Four Corners.

We priced several options and felt his was the lowest-priced (via an
initial estimate in his store), and he was the most knowledgeable
about "aesthetics".  He made a housecall and did a very thorough
(3-hour) "sizing up" of our home, taking great care with detail.  By
the way, the ONLY brand of blind that you should ever consider is
"Hunter Douglas".  (Lifetime warranty, excellent quality, dust free,
etc.  They will make housecalls to fix anything that breaks.)

The down side is that the bottom line figure was a bit more than we
had intended to spend (okay, 3 times more), but the end-product was
very nice.  We are unsure as to whether the more expensive options we
had been looking at earlier would have turned out as expensive as his
did, but given the coverage that we needed (plus all the special
options, like remote-control blinds, and top-down/bottom-up
varieties), I suspect the other options would have been more expensive
than our initial estimate as well.  

The installation was fast---half the time it took to give us the
estimate.  We like our remote-control blinds, but one bad point about
them is that there is more mechanism to get fouled up---and, in fact,
the original installation had a defective blind, which they replaced.

Anyway, I would recommend these guys, but please post others on this
page if you find better deals---the cost was the only thing we weren't
100% sure about; by the time we got blinds, we were desperate to get
them (large home w/ lots of glass!), so we may have moved more quickly
than we would have otherwise.  I do have a very good feeling that we
will always have GOOD QUALITY and EXCELLENT RESPONSE (if repairs are
ever needed).
