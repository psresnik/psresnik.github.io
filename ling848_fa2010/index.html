<h2>Description</h2>

<font color="red">Note: The content of 800-level seminars varies from
year to year, and this seminar will <strong>not</strong> cover the
same material as previous offerings of Ling848 (Seminar in
Computational Linguistics).  If you have questions about the seminar,
including any uncertainty about whether your background is appropriate
in order to attend, please contact the instructor.</font>

<P>
This is an advanced computational linguistics seminar focusing on computational 
modeling of language.  "Computational modeling" can mean many different things; indeed,
in some sense the term could be used to describe practically any computational 
work on language at all.  In this seminar, we will be focusing mainly on information
theoretic models and Bayesian modeling, with a balance between cognitive modeling
and modeling for engineering purposes.

<P>
This seminar will mainly involve readings and discussion, helped along
by participation in the <A
HREF="http://groups.google.com/group/linguistics-848-fall-2010"> online
discussion group</A>.  The class will be graded on participation (10%)
and term paper/project (90%), and I hope to encourage hands-on
projects, ideally engaging multidisciplinary teams tackling new resesarch,
aiming for papers suitable for submission to appropriate conferences.
