<h2>Description</h2>

<font color="red">Note: The content of 800-level seminars varies from
year to year, and this seminar will <strong>not</strong> cover the
same material as previous offerings of Ling848 (Seminar in
Computational Linguistics).  If you have questions about the seminar,
including any uncertainty about whether your background is appropriate
in order to attend, please contact the instructor.</font>

<P>
Over the last five years or so, the relationship between language and
opinions/sentiments has emerged as a hot topic for computational
linguistics research, and <A
HREF="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1650">Mark Liberman has
recently argued</A> that "corpus based social science" is poised to go
mainstream, despite a general historical tendency toward "linguistic
anemia" in the social sciences.  As computational linguists, we have
known for the past several decades that language use in corpora can
serve as a useful proxy for world knowledge.  With so much of people's
lives going online, we can now start imagining technology that will
exploit large-scale language use as evidence for people's individual
behaviors and social interactions, as well.
<P>
Now, "social science" is an unmanageably huge topic.  The <A
HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_sciences">Wikipedia page on
Social Sciences</A> includes disciplines ranging from archaeology to
social work.  In this seminar, we'll narrow the field somewhat,
focusing mainly on studies involving sentiment and perspective,
topical focus of attention, and the connection of linguistic variables
with social variables.  In so doing, perhaps we can begin to help find
a cure for linguistic anemia.  
<P>
This seminar will mainly involve readings and discussion, helped along
by participation in an <A
HREF="http://groups.google.com/group/umd-ling848-fall09"> online
discussion group</A>.  The class will be graded on participation (10%)
and term paper/project (90%), and I hope to encourage hands-on
projects engaging multidisciplinary teams tackling real problems,
aiming for papers suitable for submission to appropriate conferences.

"Private state" is a cover term used to refer to mental and emotional
states that are not directly observable or verifiable (Quirk et al.,
1985).  These would include, for example, opinions or sentiments,
evaluations, emotions, speculations, and intentions.
