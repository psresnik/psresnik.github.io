<PRE>
Come fill out our census
Like a good little voter
Do you live in Wisconsin?
Were you born on a farm?
Are you white or Hispanic?
Or perhaps Ashkanazim?
You told us in '90-
But tell us again.

Come fill out our census
Like that family in Utah
Like those spinsters in Texas
Like your cousin in jail
Did you serve in the army?
Is your income 6 figures?
Do you like macaroni?
Come, tell us again.

Come fill out our census
It will take just a moment.
Do you live with your parents?
Do they think you're a bum?
We won't ask who you sleep with,
But we'll ask how you worship.
Your government's listening -
So tell us again.

This was written by my dear friend, Nicki Galland, who has more time
to kill than she ought to.  It would tickle her no end if this were to
become "one of those internet spams."  As she writes, "Ah, the grand
dreams of an unemployed satirist in the age of technology. ;-)" So
send it to five friends -- and instruct them that unless they send it
to five friends immediately, their loved ones, pets, and work
colleages will all start singing "Thank God I'm a Country Boy" at
random intervals for no apparent reason...
