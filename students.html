	<em> For my former advisees, I try indicating where they wound up doing after working with me. However, it's hard to keep up with what everyone does, so please note that information may be missing or out of date.</em>
<p>
	<em> You may notice that I use the "Dr." title explicitly on this page, which is a bit more formal than typical in computational linguistics. I've done that for a long time when listing my former students, but it became more visibly important in December 2020 with the publication of a Wall Street Journal op-ed criticizing Dr. Jill Biden for her use of the title that she earned. I am not dignifying that editorial with a link, but rather I will link	<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/dr-jill-biden-wall-street-journal/2020/12/13/e43883a4-3d45-11eb-8db8-395dedaaa036_story.html">this excellent response</A>.</em>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mona-diab-55946614/">LinkedIn</a><br>
		 Mona's 2003 linguistics dissertation,<a href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~mdiab/finalthesis.pdf">"Word Sense Disambiguation Within a Multingual Framework"</a> , focused on unsupervised word sense disambiguation using parallel corpora. After graduation, she did a postdoc working with 
	  <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/">Dan Jurafsky</a> at University of Colorado and Stanford University, and has since then held leadership roles in both academia and industry. She is currently Director of the Language Technologies Institute (LTI) at Carnegie Mellon University. She was designated a Fellow of the Association for Computational Linguistics in 2023.

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/okan-kolak/"> LinkedIn</a><br>
		Okan's 2005 computer science dissertation, 
	  <a href="http://drum.umd.edu/dspace/handle/1903/3182">"Rapid Resource Transfer for Natural Language Processing"</a> , focused on development of language technology for low-resource languages by taking advantage of existing resources for well-studied languages, with applications in optical character recognition and parsing.

		His 2007 linguistics dissertation, 
		<a href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~sgreene/SGreeneDissertationFinalDist.pdf"> Spin: Lexical Semantics, Transitivity, and the Identification of Implicit Sentiment</a> (
	  <a href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~sgreene/SGreeneDissertationFinalDist-Abstract.pdf"> short abstract</a> ) focused on the way that the choice of underlying semantic properties of an event description, reflected in syntactic structures, sheds light on the speaker's attitudes about the event, a phenomenon I now call <em>syntactic framing</em>. Ideas and data collection methods in his dissertation are important precursors to work in the <A HREF="https://decomp.io/">Decompositional Semantics Initiative</A>. Stephan was a Senior Software Engineer in the NLP group at Art Technology Group (ATG) while doing his dissertation, and has progressed through a number of other industry roles to his current position as Chief Technology Officer at <a href="http://converseon.com">Converseon</a>.

		<a href="https://alopez.github.io/"> Dr. Adam Lopez</a>. (CS)<br>
		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-lopez-nlp-researcher/"> LinkedIn</a><br>
		 Adam wrote his 2008 dissertation on "Machine Translation by Pattern Matching", and he also authored a highly regarded
		<a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/alopez/pdf/survey.pdf">survey on Statistical Machine Translation</a> (<a href="http://surveys.acm.org/"> ACM Computing Surveys</a> 40(3), Sep 2008). Adam's dissertation broke new ground in the scalability of statistical MT systems, going beyond flat phrase-based representations (e.g. hierarchical phrase-based models) and making it possible to do efficient pattern matching using patterns that contain gaps. He went on to be a postdoctoral research fellow working with 
		<a href="http://www.iccs.informatics.ed.ac.uk/~pkoehn/"> Philipp Koehn</a> on 
		<a href="http://www.statmt.org/"> statistical machine translation</a> at the 
<a href="http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/"> University of Edinburgh</a>, and after intervening positions in academia and industry he is now a Reader (equivalent to Associate Professor in the U.S.) at the University of Edinburgh.

		<a href="http://yuvalmarton.com"> Dr. Yuval Marton</a>. (Linguistics)<br>
		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuvalmarton/"> LinkedIn</a><br>
		 Yuval's 2009 dissertation, entitled &ldquo;Fine-Grained Linguistic Soft Constraints on Statistical Natural Language Processing Models&rdquo;, focused on using soft syntactic and semantic constraints in end-to-end state-of-the-art statistical machine translation systems. He also introduced a novel distributional paraphrase generation technique based on monolingual phrase similarity. Yuval went on to be a post-doctoral researcher at the Columbia University Center for Computational Learning Systems (CCLS), working with Nizar Habash and Owen Rambow on syntactic parsing, focusing on Arabic parsing for statistical machine translation; he then worked in 
		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuvalmarton/"> a variety of industry positions</a> and is now Senior Principal NLP Data Scientist at <a href="https://www.gene.com/">Genentec</a>.

		<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cdyer/"> Dr. Chris Dyer</a>. (Linguistics)<br>
		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-dyer-7697b51/"> LinkedIn</a><br>
Chris's 2010 dissertation defined a new framework for modeling ambiguity, with particular application to (but far from limited to) statistical machine translation. The key idea is to move from strings to weighted sets when thinking about the inputs, outputs, and gold-standard references for supervised training in an NLP pipeline. This turns out to be a really powerful way of looking at processing, leading to empirical, algorithmic, and even theoretical (a theorem proved!) contributions. Chris did a postdoc with Noah Smith at CMU's LTI and was then faculty at CMU; he is now Senior Staff Scientist at Google DeepMind in London.


	<P><li>
		<a href="https://dl.acm.org/profile/81350567642"> Dr. Chang Hu</a> (CS, co-advised with Ben Bederson).<br>
		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/changhu/"> LinkedIn</a><br>
		Chang's 2012 dissertation developed the idea of 
		<a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/monotrans/"> monolingual translation</a>, using human-computer interaction insights, crowdsourcing, and underlying machine translation technology to create a system in which crowds of monolingual users can help each other to translate text -- in an environment where 
		<em>nobody</em> is assumed to know both the source and target language. Then he moved to be a Research Software Development Engineer at Microsoft. Chang is now a Staff Software Engineer at Compass.

Vlad's 2013 dissertation advanced online discriminative learning methods in machine translation, with applicability to other large scale structured prediction problems. After graduation he became Principal Scientist at <a href="http://fiscalnote.com"> FiscalNote</a>, and helped lead that company to its <A HREF="https://fiscalnote.com/press-room/fiscalnote-celebrates-public-company-debut-with-opening-bell-ringing-ceremony-at-new-york-stock-exchange">debut on the NY Stock Exchange</A> at a $1.2B valuation, having risen to roles as Chief Scientist, Head of AI Research, and Chief Technology Officer.
