<font size="-1">
<em>For my former advisees, I try indicate what they wound up doing after working with me. However, it's hard to keep up with what everyone does, so please note that information may be missing or out of date. </em>
<P>
<em>You may notice that I use the "Dr." title explicitly on this page, which is a bit more formal than typical in computational linguistics. I've done that for a long time when listing my former students, but it became more visibly important in December 2020 with the publication of a Wall Street Journal op-ed criticizing Dr. Jill Biden for her use of the title that she earned. I am not dignifying that editorial with a link, but rather I will link <A HREF="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/dr-jill-biden-wall-street-journal/2020/12/13/e43883a4-3d45-11eb-8db8-395dedaaa036_story.html">this excellent response</A>.</em>

<LI> <A HREF="http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~mdiab/">Dr. Mona Diab</A>. (Linguistics)<BR>
Mona's 2003 linguistics dissertation, <A
HREF="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~mdiab/finalthesis.pdf">"Word Sense
Disambiguation Within a Multingual Framework"</A>, focused on
unsupervised word sense disambiguation using parallel corpora.
After graduation, she did a postdoc working with
<A HREF="http://www.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/">Dan Jurafsky</A> at
University of Colorado and Stanford University, and was research faculty
at Columbia University. After progressing as faculty up to full professor at George Washington University,
she served as a Principal Applied Scientist at Amazon AI and is now at Facebook AI.
<P>
<LI> <A HREF="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~okan">Dr. Okan Kolak </A>. (CS) <BR>
Okan's 2005 computer science dissertation, <A HREF="http://drum.umd.edu/dspace/handle/1903/3182">"Rapid Resource
Transfer for Natural Language Processing"</A>, focused on
development of language technology for low-resource language by 
taking advantage of existing resources for well studied languages,
with applications in optical character recognition and parsing.
Now Staff Research Scientist / Technical Lead Manager at Google.
<P>
<LI> <A href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~sgreene/">Dr. Stephan Greene</A>. (Linguistics) <BR>
Stephan was a Senior Software Engineer in the NLP group
 at Art Technology Group (ATG), Inc., went on to work in clinical NLP 
 at 3M, then led NLP at <A HREF="http://www.newbrandanalytics.com/">New Brand Analytics</A>,
 was lead engineer at Sprinklr, and is currently Chief Technology Officer at <A HREF="http://converseon.com">Converseon</A>.
His 2007 linguistics dissertation, <A
 HREF="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~sgreene/SGreeneDissertationFinalDist.pdf">
 Spin: Lexical Semantics, Transitivity, and the Identification of
 Implicit Sentiment</A> (<A
 HREF="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~sgreene/SGreeneDissertationFinalDist-Abstract.pdf">short
 abstract</A>) focused on the way that the choice of underlying
 semantic properties of an event description, reflected in syntactic
 structures, sheds light on the speaker's attitudes about the event.
 The underlying connection between semantic components and perceived
 attitude was established via psycholinguistic experimentation, and
 the ideas were then operationalized using an automatic parser and
 applied in sentiment classification experiments that demonstrated
 significant improvement over the prior state of the art. He went on to be senior NLP engineer at CodeRyte, NLP lead at NewBrand Analytics, and is now a lead engineer at Sprinklr.
<P>
<LI> <A href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/alopez/">Dr. Adam Lopez</A>. (CS)<BR>
   Adam wrote his 2008 dissertation on
   Machine Translation by Pattern Matching, and he also authored an excellent 
   <A HREF="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/alopez/pdf/survey.pdf">survey on Statistical Machine Translation</A>
   coming out in <A HREF="http://surveys.acm.org/">ACM Computing Surveys</A> 40(3), Sep 2008.
   Adam's dissertation breaks new ground in the scalability of statistical MT systems that go
   beyond flat phrase-based representations (e.g. hierarchical phrase-based models), by 
   making it possible to do efficient pattern matching using patterns that contain gaps.
   He went on to be a postdoctoral research fellow working with <A
   HREF="http://www.iccs.informatics.ed.ac.uk/~pkoehn/">Philipp
   Koehn</A> on <A HREF="http://www.statmt.org/">statistical machine translation</A> at
   the <A HREF="http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/">University of Edinburgh</A>,
   then was at the Human Language Technology Center of
   Excellence at JHU, and is now on the faculty at the  University of Edinburgh.
<P>
<LI> <A href="http://yuvalmarton.com">Dr. Yuval Marton</A>. (Linguistics)<BR>
Yuval's 2009 dissertation, entitled “Fine-Grained Linguistic Soft Constraints on
Statistical Natural Language Processing Models”, focused on using soft
syntactic and semantic constraints in end-to-end state-of-the-art
statistical machine translation systems. He  also introduced a novel
distributional paraphrase generation technique based on monolingual
phrase similarity.  Yuval went on to be a post-doctoral researcher at the
Columbia University Center for Computational Learning Systems
(CCLS), working with Nizar Habash and Owen Rambow on syntactic parsing,
focusing on Arabic parsing for statistical machine translation; he then worked in <A HREF="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuvalmarton/">a variety of industry 
positions</A> and is now an NLP consultant and affiliate faculty at University of Washington.
<P>
<LI> <A href="http://www.ling.umd.edu/~redpony/">Dr. Chris Dyer</A>. (Linguistics) <BR>
 Chris's 2010 dissertation defines a new framework for
modeling ambiguity, with particular application to (but far from
limited to) statistical machine translation.  The key idea is to
move from strings to weighted sets when thinking about the inputs,
outputs, and gold-standard references for supervised training in an
NLP pipeline.  This turns out to be a really powerful way of looking
at processing, leading to empirical, algorithmic, and even theoretical
(a theorem proved!) contributions. Chris did a postdoc with
Noah Smith at  CMU's LTI and was then faculty at CMU; he is now at Google DeepMind in London.
<P>
<LI> Dr. Chang Hu (CS, co-advised with Ben Bederson). <BR>
(CS) Chang's dissertation developed the idea of <A HREF="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/monotrans/">monolingual translation</A>, using human-computer interaction insights, crowdsourcing, and underlying machine translation technology to create a system in which crowds of monolingual users can help each other to translate text -- in an environment where <em>nobody</em> is assumed to know both the source and target language.  Chang is now at Microsoft.
<P>
<LI> <A HREF="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~vlad/">Dr. Vlad Eidelmann<A>. (CS) <BR>
  Vlad's 2013 dissertation advances online discriminative learning methods in machine translation, with applicability to other large scale structured prediction problems.  Vlad is now Vice President of Research at <A HREF="http://fiscalnote.com">FiscalNote</A>.
<P>
<LI> <A HREF="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~vietan/">Dr. Viet-An Nguyen</A>.  (CS, co-advised with Jordan Boyd-Graber) <BR>
 An's thesis focused on developing probabilistic topic models for applications in natural language processing and computational social science, with particular application to computational political science. He's now a Data Scientist in the Core Data Science team at Facebook working on 
computational methods to study interesting latent structures extracted from observed data.
