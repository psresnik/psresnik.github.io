<strong>August 31, 2016.</strong> Thinking computationally about parsing.
<P>
After some administrivial and general preliminaries, we'll begin by looking at how the parsing problem is introduced in computational linguistics. In the process of looking at a textbook NLP introduction to syntactic parsing, we'll make sure everyone gets up to speed on some core computational concepts like search, time and space complexity, formal description of parsing algorithms. We'll also include discussion of computational modeling a bit more generally, assisted by Marr's levels of description.

<P>
<strong>Readings</strong>

<p><li> Jurafsky and Martin, Chapter 13, Syntactic Parsing
  <ul>
    <p><li> You might also find the following useful

	  <p><li> Shieber et al., <A HREF="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/shieber/Biblio/Papers/infer.pdf">Principles and Implementation of Deductive Parsing</A> (see Sections 1-3).  Incidentally, I've realized that my specific characterization of deductive parsing as "logic plus control" (the latter discussed in Section 5) was, without doing so consciously, a reference to Kowalski (1979), <A HREF="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=359136">Algorithm = logic + control</A>.

  </ul>
<p><li> Marr, D. (1982), Vision: A Computational Approach, San Francisco, Freeman & Co., <a

</ul>
<P>

<P>
<strong>Optional homework</strong>
<P>
<blockquote>
To really solidify your understanding of top down and bottom up parsing, I recommend you work your way through the top-down example on pages 7-9 of Shieber et al., and then 
see if you can understand the bottom-up shift-reduce parser and work through the example on pages 10-11 without first looking at the answer.
<P>
If you want to get hands on, a good starting point would be <A HREF="http://www.nltk.org/book/ch08.html">Chapter 8, Analyzing Sentence Structure</A> from the <A HREF="http://www.nltk.org/book/">NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) book</A>. NLTK is a suite of open source Python modules, data sets and tutorials supporting research and development in natural language processing and it can be very useful for (self-)learning.
</blockquote>

<P>
<strong>Optional background</strong>
<P>
<blockquote>
There is, of course, a voluminous literature in psycholinguistics discussing parsing from a computational angle, albeit not computational modeling <em>per se</em>. An early review touching on many of the major issues from a psycholinguistic perspective is
<ul>
  <p><li>Frazier, Lyn (1987), <A href="http://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/~plaut/IntroPDP/papers/Frazier87.sentProcRev.pdf">"Sentence processing: A tutorial review"</A>, in Coltheart, M., Attention and Performance XII: The Psychology of Reading, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates,
</ul>
and a more current example reviewing some relevant issues, focused on comprehension of relative clauses, is 
<ul>
  <p><li> P. Gordon and M. Lowder, <A HREF="http://www.unc.edu/~pcg/personal/documents/GordonLowder%20Language%20and%20Linguistic%20Compass%202012.pdf">"Complex Sentence Processing: A Review of Theoretical Perspectives on the Comprehension of Relative Clauses"</A>, Language and Linguistics Compass 6/7 (2012): 403â€“415, 10.1002/lnc3.347.

Thoughts...

What's a computational model? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_model


  - Mathematical model using computational resources to study the behavior of a complex system by computer simulation
     - Crucially, simulation is always simulation OF something taking place in real-world space and time
     - Think about Turing test as a measure of success: goal is to simulate the appropriate input/output behavior
  - Contrasts with deriving an analytic solution to the problem
  - Contrasts with intensional characterization (cf. T-diagram characterization of a generative system)
  - Contrasts with hypothesis testing - probes system to test predictions which may or may not have associated simulation

  Experimentation with a model is done by adjusting the parameters of the system in the computer, and studying the differences in the outcome of the experiments.

  Operation theories of the model can be derived/deduced from these computational experiments.

Read: "It's Made of Meat"

Inductive bias, e.g. We're only going to consider grammars that have no more than 12 nonterminal symbols

Stealing from 1-23-13 psychosem lecture by Paul (http://files.ling.umd.edu/locker/Psychosemantics/):
  Lewis: Language and Languages
  lambda(x)|x - 1| vs. lambda(x) sqrt|x^2 - 2x + 1| [give examples of O() for time and space] <-- misleading?
  extensional description as a set = computational level (input/output relation)
  intensional description: theorist has to write down a procedure to characterize unbounded set
  object itself can be described in many ways
  but for computational description, you need to talk about specific representations and a specific algorithms
  (which themselves can be realized/implemented in many ways)
  Chomsky: object to study is the procedure for "calculating English" - what do we mean by "procedure"?
  when studying human parsing, we're talking about the alg/rep level description for a procedure that is implemented in realtime comprehension

What's presupposed and/or taken as given?
  We assume there is a grammar - questions of what is a grammar from a computational perspective?
  We take as given that parsing takes place in real time
  Input: for the most part we'll assume sequences of words (broader issue of what the "signal" is)
  Output: for the most part we'll assume this means a structural description (n.b. distinguish output of derivation from derivation itself; cf. XTAG)
  Goal: identifying structure is a part of the construction of interpretations (bigger issue of what meanings/interpretations are)

Example: Furniture assembly (contrasting generative perspective vs. "in space and time" perspective) [Marr level 1]
  Abstract procedure: f:Diagram,Instructions -> Valid set of instructions
     "TIME INDEPENDENT recursive specification" to define possible languages (inductive bias in learning mechanism) = grammar
  "Generation": f:Diagram -> Instructions
  "Comprehension": f:Instructions -> Diagram

Marr and hypothesis spaces
  extensional characterization of what you're trying to compute (embeds many assumptions, e.g. competence/performance distinction)
  algorithmic - many intensional ways of computing each extension (e.g. |x-1| vs. sqrt|x^2 - 2x + 1|)
  implemented - many ways of implementing each computation (e.g. silicon vs. meat)

Notion of a "procedure"
  Turing machine an abstraction of the typewriter
  "Algorithm" is just as "abstract" as the set-theoretic extension itself
  But characterozomg human parsing involves steps that take place in space and time

Competence and performance
  Chomsky's logic of looking for conditions when system breaks, and when certain signals don't occur
  Here: interested not just in the fact that something is ungrammatical, but what people do when they try to process it

But, human system heavily DRIVEN by what actually occurs, even if constrained by a system that also characterizes what doesn't occur

<strong>December 7, 2016.</strong> Neural network language processing
<P>

This week we'll be doing more of an introduction to a class of methods, rather than a deep dive into a specific piece of research about computational modeling of human parsing.
<P>
Plan:
<ul>
<p><li> Philip will do a more lecture-style discussion of Yoav Goldberg, <A HREF="http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~yogo/nnlp.pdf">A Primer on Neural Network Models for Natural Language Processing</A> sections 10-12. Earlier sections of this primer may be useful background in order to get core ideas and understand notation.
<p><li> We'll probably zoom in on LSTMs in particular, for which Colah, <A HREF="http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/">Understanding LSTM Networks</A> would be worth looking at.
<p><li> Please look over Linzen et al., <A HREF="http://tallinzen.net/media/papers/linzen_dupoux_goldberg_2016_tacl.pdf">Assessing the ability of LSTMs to learn syntax-sensitive dependencies</A>.
