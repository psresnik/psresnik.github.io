<h1>New Arrival!  Harry Scott Resnik -- November 21, 2005</h1>

<ul>

<P>
<LI> Our <A HREF="100_0005.JPG"> Halloween jackolanterns</A> included
 one for Becky (below) and one for baby (above).  As you can tell,
 things got a little busy and they, um, decorated our doorstep for a
 really long time.

<P>
<LI> Shortly before Harry was due, it was time to get
 a new digital camera.  <A HREF="100_0001.JPG">This first photo</A>
 at the camera store definitely shows Ben and me looking our best.

<P>
<LI> <A HREF="100_0003.JPG">Pre-baby Becky</A> doing a photographic
simulation of post-baby Becky.

<P>
<LI> <A HREF="100_0006.JPG">Serious nesting</A>.

<P>
<LI> <A HREF="100_0008.JPG">I</A> was working hard, too.

<P>
<LI> Annie with good friend Rob Katz, showing
  us she knows <A HREF="100_0012.JPG">how to greet a new arrival</A>.

<P>
<LI> Oh, you were waiting for photos of a <em>baby</em>?
  Look!  <A HREF="100_0013.JPG">It's a baby!</A>

<P>
<LI> Becky with her mom, dad, and <A HREF="100_0016.JPG">a bundle named Harry</A>.

<P>
<LI> We haven't gotten very good yet at posing Harry for photos, 
  but this one shows that he's got a bunch of  <A
  HREF="100_0017.JPG">very fine, light hair</A>.  

<P>
<!-- <LI> Another really sweet  <A HREF="100_0018.JPG">mommy shot</A> -->

<P>
<LI> Oh, yeah, sometimes <A HREF="100_0019.JPG">Dad gets to be in
  the picture, too!</A>

<P>
<!-- <LI> <A HREF="100_0020.JPG">100_0020.JPG</A> -->

<P>
<LI> This one's rated <A HREF="100_0022.JPG">PG-13</A>.  (Though
 Becky's smile wins an Academy Award.)  And here's  <A
 HREF="100_0024.JPG">another sweet one</A>.

<P>
<!-- <LI> Bless you, <A HREF="100_0023.JPG">Dr. Abraham</A>. -->

<P>
<LI> A very nice picture of <A HREF="100_0027.JPG">Grandma Ros with Harry</A>.

<P>
<LI> Yup, that's what <A HREF="100_0028.JPG">a newborn</A> looks like!
  Notice Ros's utter mastery of the tilt-the-baby-for-the-photo
  technique.  We'll have that down after four kids, too.  (Just
  kidding, Becky, just kidding...)
  
<P>
<LI> Clearly I <A HREF="100_0032.JPG">haven't mastered the
  tilt-the-baby technique</A>; basically I've been 
  <A HREF="100_0033.JPG">too happy</A> to think about it.
  But I promise I'll practice.
