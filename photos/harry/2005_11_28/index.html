<h1>More Harry photos</h1>
<ul>
<LI> If you're only going to look at one picture of Harry,
   <A HREF="100_0055.JPG"><em>this is the one</em></A>.
<LI> I absolutely love this beautiful photo of 
     <A HREF="100_0034.JPG">Ben and his new little brother</A>.
<LI> Here's another one I love: <A HREF="100_0051.JPG">Harry with Ben,
  my dad, and me</A>.
<LI> Here's a sweet one of <A HREF="100_0037.JPG">Harry with Grandma Ros</A>
<LI> <A HREF="100_0049.JPG">Harry with Grandma Elaine and Grandpa
  Marty</A>.  Boy, what a happy photo.
<LI> A very content baby with <A HREF="100_0040.JPG">Becky's sister
  Liz</A>.  Don't know why Ben is looking so mischievous!
<LI> <A HREF="100_0057.JPG">Sleeping boys</A> (well, one of them, anyway).
<LI> Jeez.  Put Ben in charge of the camera and 
  <A HREF="100_0062.JPG">look what happens?</A>
  <A HREF="100_0063.JPG">Um...</A>
  <A HREF="100_0064.JPG">Ben?</A>
<LI> Ok, Ben made up for his, um, artistic endeavors with some decent
  shots of Harry's first bath.  Here I'm <A
  HREF="100_0069.JPG">protecting Harry's modesty</A>, or more likely
  protecting myself, as you'll realize if you know anything about
  little baby boys.  Here is <A HREF="100_0073.JPG">Harry's most
  cherubic photo so far</A>.
