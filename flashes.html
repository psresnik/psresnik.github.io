<font color="red">News flash (December 21, 2024).</font> UMD colleagues and I have just been awarded a university seed grant for a project called "Computational Social Neuroscience in the Wild". The project will investigate real-time social situations by using computational models of behavior during natural two-way social interactions. It seeks to build a more integrated computational framework of how the brain learns about, dynamically updates, and communicates with a social partner. We'll be collecting data from people's brains as they engage in collaborative tasks and looking at how common ground (in the linguistic sense) relates to synchrony of neural activity.  Hopefully this will produce pilot data suitable for a full scale NIH research proposal in a year or so.

The paper is currently in peer review and argues that harmful biases are an inevitable consequence arising from the design of any large language model as LLMs are currently formulated, and therefore we need a serious reconsideration of AI driven by LLMs, going back to the foundational assumptions underlying their design.
