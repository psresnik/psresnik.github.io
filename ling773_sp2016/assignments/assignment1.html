<h1>Assignment 1</h1>

<P>
<HR>
<strong>Along with your answer to each of these questions, please tell us roughly how long it took you to answer the question.  This assignment is largely a reality check, to make sure you're comfortable with basic background and skills the course will require.</strong>
<HR>
<P>
<strong>Question 1.</strong>  After signing up on <A HREF="http://piazza.com/umd/spring2016/ling773cmsc773inst728c">https://piazza.com/umd/spring2016/ling773cmsc773inst728c/</A>,
please complete this <A HREF="http://goo.gl/forms/6AXOLZhT4z">Google Survey</A>. Although this assigment is not due until next class, it would be really helpful to get responses to the survey as soon as possible, ideally before the end of the weekend, since they could influence planning for upcoming lectures.

<strong>Question 2.</strong>  In the car a while back, my son (then four years old) generated 
the following utterance:
<pre>
The lady didn't go and you beeped her out of the way so we could wented to school.
</pre>
Well, yes, ok, I did in fact beep my horn at the car in front of me on our way to 
school.  Children tend to notice these things.
But the light was green, and she wasn't moving!  (For the record, 
despite the fact that I learned to drive in New York,
this particular instance of horn beeping was what we call a "gentle tap", which is 
<A HREF="https://books.google.com/books?id=BvzgAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA25&dq=%22gentle+tap+on+the+horn%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjj7IeYgsvKAhWFSSYKHe1pAvUQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q=%22gentle%20tap%20on%20the%20horn%22&f=false">officially approved by driving instructors</A>.)
<P>
From an NLP perspective, my son's sentence is chock full of interesting stuff.  For each of the following terms or concepts,
(a) briefly define what the term means, preferably in your own words; (b) discuss where the concept is relevant in this example, if it is, or why you think it's not relevant; and (c) where appropriate, comment on any ways in which this sentence might be particularly challenging for an NLP system.
<ul>
<li> Morphology
<li> Subcategorization
<li> Syntactic ambiguity
<li> Clause
<li> Word sense ambiguity
<li> Coreference
</ul>

The point of this question is to make sure that you've at least encountered these concepts, even if you have to look them up in the index 
of Manning &amp; Schuetze or on Wikipedia.  Most or all of them should be familiar to anyone who has taken CompLing1 or equivalent.
<em>Don't spend more than 5 minutes on any one of these</em>.  And, again, it's ok for people
to work together and discuss things, as long as you're telling me explicitly who deserves credit for what.  If you're not a native speaker
of English, I strongly encourage you to talk with one.

<strong>Question 3.</strong> Recall that Bayes's Rule is often used in "Bayesian
updating", since it is used to take a <em>prior</em> probability
distribution and update it on the basis of observed evidence to
produce a <em>posterior</em> distribution.  Before, after, hence
updating; get it?
<P>
This notion of "Bayesian updating" is particularly useful when applied
iteratively.  Consider a scenario where we have a prior distribution
P(H) over hypotheses, and then we observe evidence E1 and 
use Bayes's Rule to update our distribution to
<pre>
               P(E1 | H) P(H)
  P(H | E1) =  --------------
                 P(E1)
</pre>
The distribution P(H|E1) can now be viewed as a new, more informed
prior.  Therefore if we see a new piece of evidence E2, we can use
Bayes's Rule again to derive a new posterior.  Since P(H|E1) is the
prior now, the result will take
the form
<pre>
                  X  P(H | E1)
  P(H | E1,E2) =  ------------
                       Y
</pre>
<P>
Derive the simplest possible form of the full expression, i.e. 
fill in X and Y, assuming that E1 and E2 are independent.
(Note that if you don't make that assumption, you won't get the right answer.)

<strong>Question 4.</strong> First, if necessary, review Manning &amp; Schuetze Section 2.1, on 
foundational concepts in probability theory.
<P>
Then, go to <A HREF="http://www.wolframalpha.com/">Wolfram Alpha</A>
and try typing the following things into the box at the top (and then hit Enter or click the "=" sign).
<ul>
<li> BinomialDistribution[10, 0.5]
<li> BinomialDistribution[100, 0.5]
</ul>
Fun, huh?  Ok, now try it with the Beta distribution:
<ul>
<li> BetaDistribution[1,1]
<li> BetaDistribution[2,2]
<li> BetaDistribution[10,10]
<li> BetaDistribution[2,10]
<li> BetaDistribution[10,2]
</ul>
<!-- http://www.fortunecity.co.uk/meltingpot/back/340/product/java/cdfdemomain.html -->

<P>
<strong>4(a)</strong> Look at the PDFs (probability density functions)
for each one, and explain in plain English what each of these Beta
distributions represents, when interpreted as a Bayesian prior for the
probability of heads. (To keep things standard, let's all assume that
the prior belief is about the probability of heads for a
possibly-unfair coin.)  What is your expectation about what the probability of heads
will be, and how strongly do you think so?
<P>
<strong>4(b)</strong> Let's take the notion of "expectation" in (4a) a
little more literally, as in <em>expected value</em>, also known as
the <em>mean</em> of the distribution.  Try typing
BetaDistribution[&alpha;,&beta;] for some other values of &alpha; and
&beta;, and look at the number Wolfram Alpha reports as the "mean".
Can you figure out what the formula for the mean is, as a function of
&alpha; and &beta;?  (If you can't give an exact formula, at least
comment on some properties of the mean.  If you already knew the
formula, it's ok to tell me so.  But <em>don't</em> just look up the 
mean of the Beta distribution and copy it down; what would you learn from that?!.)  </ul>

<strong>Question 5.</strong> Create a "quick and dirty" program that takes the text of this homework assignment (that is <A HREF="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/ling773_sp2016/assignments/assignment1.html">this Web page</A>) and produces as output the 20 most frequent bigrams, excluding any bigrams containing <A HREF="http://www.ranks.nl/stopwords">stopwords</A>.  Briefly explain how you did this, including any choices you made in the interest of keeping things "quick and dirty" (e.g. with respect to tokenization, normalization, etc.) that you would improve if you were doing this for real.

Note that the goal here is <em>not</em> to impress me with how <em>well</em> you can write a program to extract bigrams; see the definition of <A HREF="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/quick-and-dirty">quick and dirty</A> if you weren't already familiar with the term.  Using existing code is ok.  If you can find existing code out there that contains a function called 

<pre>extract-nonstoplist-bigrams-from-a-web-page-and-sort-by-frequency</pre>

by all means go ahead and use it. Ok, that probably doesn't exist, but if you want to use an existing toolkit, that's fine. Like the other questions on this assignment, this is a reality check: if you find it very challenging or time consuming, then we should probably talk about whether this course is right for you.

<strong>Question 6.</strong> Read this blog posting about <A HREF="https://civisanalytics.com/blog/data-science/2016/01/15/data-science-on-state-of-the-union-addresses/">"Data Science on State of the Union Addresses: Obama (2016) vs. Obama (2015) vs. ... vs. George Washington (1790)"</A>. Are there any technical terms or ideas here that you don't understand, and if so, what's your best guess as to what they mean? What do you think of the analysis -- do you find it convincing? What ideas would you suggest for improving it?


<P>
<HR>
<strong>Question 7.</strong> Do the reading for next class.  Ok, that's not exactly a question, it's more of a reminder. But many people need the reminder. :)
