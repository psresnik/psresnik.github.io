<h2>Description</h2>

<font color="red">Note: The content of 800-level seminars varies from
year to year, and this seminar will <strong>not</strong> cover the
same material as previous offerings of Ling848 (Seminar in
Computational Linguistics), although it does overlap with <A
 HREF="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/ling848_fa2009/">my Fall 2009
seminar</A>.  If you have questions about the seminar, including any
uncertainty about whether your background is appropriate in order to
attend, please contact me.</font>

<P> Back in 2009, <A
   HREF="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1650">Mark Liberman
  argued on Language Log</A> that "corpus based social science" was
  poised to go mainstream, despite a general historical tendency
  toward "linguistic anemia" in the social sciences.  As computational
  linguists, we have known for the past several decades that language
  use in corpora can serve as a useful proxy for world knowledge.
  With so much of people's lives going online, it was time to start
  imagining technology that would exploit large-scale language use as
  evidence for people's individual properties, behaviors, and social interactions,
  as well.

<P> Since then, there's no doubt that Mark was right. A September 9,
  2013 Time magazine article entitled <A
   HREF="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2150609,00.html">
  "What Twitter Says to Linguists"</A> mentions that "upwards of 150
  Twitter-based studies have come out in 2013 so far", and has a nice
  quote from <A HREF="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~jeisenst/">Jacob
  Eisenstein</A>, whose work is featured in the article: "Language is
  really a window into people's sense of personal identity".

<P> Now, "social science" is an unmanageably huge topic.  The <A
  HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_sciences">Wikipedia page
 on Social Science</A> includes disciplines ranging from archaeology
 to social work.  In this seminar, we'll narrow the field somewhat.
 I'm particularly interested in the idea of <A
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(cognitive)">perspective</A>,
 in the Oxford Dictionary sense of "a particular attitude toward or
 way of regarding something; a point of view".  This seems to me to be
 a focal issue in the social sciences: our perspectives help to define
  who we are, and they influence the decisions we make and the nature
  of the other individuals and groups with which we consider ourselves associated.
 Within computational linguistics, <A
  HREF="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/llee/opinion-mining-sentiment-analysis-survey.html">sentiment
  analysis</A> is a familiar subset of perspective emphasizing the
  way that language communicates positive, neutral, and negative polarity, but there are many other
  ways of looking at perspective that are to my mind equally (and
  more!) interesting.

<P> With that in mind I'm going to organize the content primarily,
although perhaps not exclusively, around two main themes.

<ul>
  <li> The first of these is <em>computational political science</em>, a
research topic is trending strongly right now.  There the idea of
perspective emerges strongly in discussions of <a href="">ideology</a>
and <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_(social_sciences)">framing</A>.
Some example questions of interest... How can we identify the ideological
positions of individuals from the language they use?  How is language
used to emphasize or deemphasize aspects of an issue under discussion
in order to persuade or influence others?  How do we computationally
characterize and model influence in political discourse?
<P>
  <li>  The second is <em>computational approaches to
 psychology</em>.  This may seem incredibly different as a
 domain, and that's ok -- diversity keeps things interesting -- but at
 the same time I think there are some important commonalities even
 though here computational modeling approaches are
 just beginning to emerge: psychological properties of individuals
 (e.g. gender, neuroticism) and clinical conditions (such as depression)
 are closely connected with the way that those individuals perceive
 the world and how they respond to it.  Some example questions of
 interest... How can we identify psychological properties or
 conditions of individuals from the language they use?  How can we
 track progress (or decline) of clinical conditions over time in a
 minimally invasive or intrusive way?
</ul>
<P>

This seminar will mainly involve readings and in-class discussion,
helped along by participation in <a
 href="https://piazza.com/umd/fall2013/ling848/home">discussions on
Piazza</a>.  The class will be graded on participation (30%), which
includes leading class discussions, as well as a term paper/project
(70%).  I hope to encourage hands-on projects that involve real
problems, aiming for papers suitable for submission to appropriate
conferences.  <P>

"Private state" is a cover term used to refer to mental and emotional
states that are not directly observable or verifiable (Quirk et al.,
1985).  These would include, for example, opinions or sentiments,
evaluations, emotions, speculations, and intentions.
