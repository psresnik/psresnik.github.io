<LI> [10pts] Prove that cross entropy H(p,q) = H(p) + D(p||q).
     <P> 
     Notice that since
     D(p||q) must be greater than or equal to 0, this establishes
     that cross entropy is an upper bound on entropy.  
<P>


<LI> [10pts] Construct two n-gram language models: M_d
based on the Democratic speeches and M_r from the
Republican speeches. Treating Obama's speech as a test set, compare the perplexity of
models M_d and M_r.  Which one is a better language model?
<P>
Using a a unigram model is fine, and the previous problem should
already give you most of what you need.  If you're interested in being
more realistic, a bigram or trigram model would be more interesting
and realistic, although of course these data sets are unrealistically
small.  If you're feeling like this assignment was too easy and you
want to do something more challenging and real, you could try using <A
HREF="http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/">the SRI language
modeling toolkit (srilm)</A>, and/or using different corpora that
might give you interesting results.
<P>

<li> <strong>Optional, for up to 10 points extra credit.</strong> Here's an oppotunity to get a little real-world
practice at creating corpora from raw data and working with them.  We'll do an analysis similar to what you
did above, but using <A
HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-state-union-address
">Obama's 2010 State of the Union address</A> and <A
HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/01/25/remarks-president-state-union-address">2011
State of the Union Address</A>, in order to answer the questions below.  (You're welcome to download the
transcripts from other sites if that makes it easier to extract the
text.) Note that I haven't actually done this, so it's possible that
these questions will have answers that are either surprising or
boring.  E.g. in part b, it's possible that there are no particularly
interesting observations to make regarding similarity of one pair
versus the other.  If that turns out to be the case, say so and
explain why that's your conclusion.  Similarly for part c.
<P>
<ul>
<li>  a. Describe the steps you took to extract the text from the State of the Union  Web pages and turn it into corpora.
<P>
<li>  b. How does Obama's speech in 2011 compare with what he said back in 2010?  In 2009?  Which is it more similar to?  
      Choose for yourself how you're going to measure "similar", and justify why that's a reasonable choice.
<P>
<li>  c. What words and/or phrases illustrate contrasts among the
      speeches, and/or progression or changes over time?  Again,
      decide for yourself what technical choices to make in order to answer this question,
      and justify those choices.  Feel free to draw on ideas and code from the previous 
      assignment, if you'd like.
<P>
