<H1>Sabbatical Plans</H1>

What am I doing on my sabbatical?  Well, getting a whole lot of cool
research done!  I've been staying local, as a visiting associate
professor at Johns Hopkins University, and I'm continuing to progress
strongly with my students and colleagues at UMD while also
strengthening our collaborations on language technology research with
the Hopkins gang (as well as beginning some new cognitive work with
Barbara Landau).
<P>
As a side activity, particularly on drives to/from Hopkins, I am
working on learning Arabic.  I'm finding that the <A

especially supplemented by good books on

of the language</A>.

<H2>General Schedule</H2>

In general, I am on the Johns Hopkins campus one day per week, almost
always Wednesday.  Other days I generally work from home.  I should
continue to be reachable by <A HREF="mailto:resnik [AT] umd.edu">e-mail</A>.
(During this sabbatical, though, I'm trying to train myself to work
for reasonable periods of time -- say a whole morning or a whole
afternoon -- without the distraction of e-mail.  So my e-mail
responsiveness may vary.)
