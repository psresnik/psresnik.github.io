<h2>Where/When</h2>

Currently planning Tuesdays 2-4:30pm in EGR 1110 (Martin Engineering Classroom Bldg, <A HREF="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Glenn+L.+Martin+Hall,+4298+Campus+Dr,+College+Park,+MD+20742/@38.988892,-76.9407383,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x89b7c6a2c70bb931:0xc58445ebbfc261f8!8m2!3d38.988892!4d-76.9381634!16s%2Fg%2F1tk1zykn?entry=ttu">"Google Maps"</A>, <A HREF="">Campus Map</A>), although this could still wind up being changed.  The plan for this is to be an in-person class but I may add hybrid Zoom participation in order to facilitate wide access to people who are interested.


<h2>Overview of Course Goals</h2>

In this seminar we'll explore computational approaches to pragmatics as interpreted in a very broad sense. I'm interested both in the computational angle on relevant cognitive and social science questions, and also in the way that language technologies are addressing pragmatics-related aspects of language understanding, or not. (Almost certainly including a very strong presence of deep learning and large language models in many of our discussions, but the intended audience here is a multidisciplinary one, not just people who view themselves as computational -- people from all interested disciplines are welcome.)
<P>
In general, I expect this to be a readings-and-discussion course.  Typically students are responsible for reading papers or articles, posting a "reactions piece" ahead of class, participating in class discussions, leading some number of class discussions during the semester, and doing a final project that results in a term paper.
<P>
This course page is currently just a stub, and in particular the specific readings are yet to be determined (and I'm open to input).
<P>
More details will arrive in (over)due time!

  <ul>
    <p><li> Note that the schedule currently leaves open most of the classes after spring break, identifying relevant topics but not the specific material we'll cover or when. Plans will get firmed up as we move forward, partly influenced by the discussions and people's interests.  I am also leaving open the possibility that the last class might be used for informal in-progress presentations and discussions of projects.
    <p><li> Also note that the schedule is likely to be flexible; e.g., it would not be uncommon to continue a class discussion into the following week. Please make sure to keep up with what's happening from week to week rather than relying on the written schedule.

<h2>Overview of Course Goals</h2>

This is an interdisciplinary seminar designed to bring together AI folks with neuro folks, and more broadly to engage people who are interested in language from the perspectives of computational linguistics, psycholinguistics, and cognitive neuroscience. The class is dubbed "Brain Inspired Inspired" because it's significantly inspired by <A HREF="https://braininspired.co/podcast/">Brain Inspired</A>, an excellent podcast hosted by Paul Middlebrooks that focuses on the convergence of AI and neuroscience. We are <em>not</em> going to try to replicate <A HREF="https://braininspired.co/course-waitlist/">his online neuro-AI course</A>, although it looks really good, because the goals here are a bit more specific. The neuro-plus-AI aspect is the same, but this is intended to be an advanced readings/discussion seminar rather than a cross-disciplinary introduction, and we're going to focus more specifically on language than Middlebrooks does (as opposed to his broader range of topics including things like vision, animal thinking, and consciousness). Because it's going to be a mixed crowd, we certainly <em>will</em> be doing a certain amount of getting up to speed in relevant sub-areas, e.g. making sure that neuro folks get comfortable with deep learning concepts, and that CS/AI folks get comfortable with differences in brain imaging methods.  But the basics are going to get addressed in the process of reading and discussing, for the most part, rather than by a lot of standard lecture/instruction.
<P>
The design of the seminar is largely motivated by the following questions:  
<ul>
  <p><li> What kinds of scientific questions about language are cognitive neuroscientists trying to answer? What role can computational modeling (of the computational linguistics variety) play in helping to answer those questions?
  <p><li> Current "neural network" methods in NLP have about as much to do with the brain as they did in the 1950s, which is to say not very much at all. Isn't there more about the brain that might be worth knowing as we try to develop better NLP methods?
</ul>

<h2>Grading</h2>
This seminar will mainly involve readings and discussion in class and on Piazza.

<ul>
<p><li> <strong>Reaction/discussion essays</strong> (20%).
<P>
For <em>all</em> attending students (whether registered, auditing, or otherwise), you're required to do the readings and,
<em>no later than the Monday night before class</em>, write a post to the <A HREF="https://piazza.com/umd/fall2023/ling848/home">class discussion board</A> containing (in a single post):
<ul>
<pi><li> A summary/synthesis of your “takeaways” from the previous class (incl. any post-class discussion that was had that you think was valuable), on the course’s Piazza discussion page
<pi><li> A short reaction-paper to the coming week’s readings, to help get the in-class discussion started
<ul>
  <p><li> Can include: assumptions you encountered that are unfamiliar to you; things you didn’t understand; things you did understand that you strongly agree/disagree with.
  </ul>
</ul>

<p><li> <strong>Participation</strong> (30%).
This includes:
<ul>
<p><li> Participating on the class discussion board (see above). The Monday due date for reaction writeups is designed so that people can get some discussion going online ahead of class, so that in class we're already ramped up.
<p><li> Presentations/leading of discussion in class. We will rotate this responsibility during the semester, and I'd like that to include even people who are not there for a grade.  Please indicate your availability at [link to poll].
<p><li> Participating actively in discussions during class.
</ul>

<p><li> <strong>Term paper or project</strong> (50%).
<p>
About halfway through the semester, we will discuss possible papers or projects. <em>These projects are due on Monday, May 16th</em>, though I'm happy to discuss your thoughts on projects earlier if you'd like.
<P>
In the two lectures before spring break, we're going to cover two platforms for computional modeling, one for fMRI data and one for MEG (or EEG) data, and although I'm open to discussion of other possibilities, my hope is that many folks (ideally teams involving a CS oriented person paired with a neurolinguistics oriented person) will design and execute a study using one of those platforms.
<P>
We may use the class time on May 4 (last day of class, two weeks ahead of the project due date) for preliminary presentations/discussion of projects.  
<P>
</ul>

<P>
<h2>'Incomplete' as a grade</h2>

My standard practice is not to issue an 'incomplete' as a course grade except for serious, officially valid reasons, e.g. documented medical accommodations or serious emergencies.  (In cases like that you should let me know in advance or as quickly as can reasonably be expected, and to provide documentation signed by a health care professional.)   That's my normal policy because it's very easy to take an incomplete and then for things to slip further and further; incompletes just aren't good for students if they can possibly be avoided.
<P>
However, the pandemic is also creating major disruptions in people's lives, so I'm more open to discussion than most years.  If you are having problems of any kind, please talk to me as soon as possible. The best first step in case of trouble of any kind is good communication.  Please also see the note below regarding <A HREF="#mentalhealth">mental health issues</A>.


<H2>Other important notes</H2>

<strong>Use of electronic devices in class (and remotely).</strong> I recognize that electronic devices can be extremely useful learning tools in the classroom. You are expected to behave as responsible adults, though, and limit the use of such devices to class-related activities only -- for example, (a) note-taking and (b) doing quick Google searches to confirm your impression that I did, in fact, say something that's utterly incorrect, so that you can shame me publicly as authoritatively as possible.
This policy applies to remote participants, too. I'd be really grateful if people could not multi-task online in ways that are not directly related to what's going on in the classroom. Please don't be reading news, checking mail, using Slack, debugging code, or whatever else. It's just rude.

<P>
<strong>Use of pets and small children in class (and remotely).</strong>  I recommend against the use of pets or small children in the classroom, for their own well-being and because your classmates might be allergic to either or both. You are, however, welcome to share your pets and small children onscreen remotely, as long as it doesn't get too distracting and we have the option of possibly using them as experimental subjects in final projects.

<P>
<strong>Course evaluations.</strong> I welcome your suggestions for improving this class, so please don’t hesitate to share your thoughts during the semester! You will also be asked to give feedback using the <A HREF="http://www.courseevalum.umd.edu/">CourseEvalUM</A> system at the end of the semester. 
<P>

<strong>Academic integrity policy.</strong> The <A HREF="https://academiccatalog.umd.edu/undergraduate/registration-academic-requirements-regulations/academic-integrity-student-conduct-codes/">Academic Integrity and Student Conduct Codes</A> prohibit students from cheating on exams, plagiarizing papers, submitting the same paper for credit in two courses without authorization, buying papers, submitting fraudulent documents, forging signatures, etc. I expect you to follow the academic integrity policy but I am exempting the class from the requirement of hand-writing and signing the honor pledge.
<P>

<strong>Cheating and collaboration.</strong>  What you represent as your own work must be your own work. However, talking with one another to understand the material better is strongly encouraged. Recognizing the distinction between cheating and cooperation is very important. If you simply copy someone else's work, you are cheating. If you let someone else copy your work, you are cheating. If someone dictates something to you, you are cheating. Everything you hand in must be in your own words, and based on your own understanding. If someone helps you understand a problem or issue during a high-level discussion, you are not cheating. If you work collaboratively with explicit permission from the instructor, you are not cheating. I strongly encourage students to help one another understand the material presented in class, in the readings, and general issues relevant to any assignments. Any student who is caught cheating will be given an F in the course and referred to the University Student Behavior Committee. Please don't take that chance -- if you're having trouble understanding the material, or if you need some help clarifying what is ok to do and what is not, please let me know and I will be more than happy to help.
<P>

<strong>Accessibility and Disability Service.</strong> See <A HREF="https://www.counseling.umd.edu/ads">https://www.counseling.umd.edu/ads</A> for official information.
Students with a documented disability should inform me within the add-drop period if academic accommodations will be needed. We will follow a process that involves meeting with me to provide with a copy of the Accommodations Letter and to obtain my signature on the Acknowledgement of Student Request form. We will plan together how accommodations will be implemented throughout the semester. To obtain the required Accommodation Letter, please contact Accessibility and Disability Service (ADS) at 301-314-7682 or adsfrontdesk@umd.edu.

<A NAME="mentalhealth">
<strong>Mental health issues.</strong> Let's face it: grad school can be <em>really</em> hard. And it's way harder in a pandemic. Sometimes students don't know that they need help, or they somehow know they're in trouble but they don't know what to do about it.  What's really important for you to know is that at a big university like this one, <em>you don't need to cope with it alone</em>.  There are many people on this campus who know how to help students in all kinds of circumstances. It's their job. Some resources you can take advantage of include the <A HREF="http://www.counseling.umd.edu/">Counseling Center</A>, in the Shoemaker Building, 301-314-7651, and <A HREF="http://www.health.umd.edu/mentalhealth/services">Behavioral Health Services</A>, in the Health Center, 301-314-8106; the <A HREF="http://www.studentaffairs.umd.edu/">Office of Student Affairs</A>, 301-314-8430, is another place you can connect with to find help of various kinds.
If you are concerned about the behavior of another student, and in particular if you are worried that they might pose a threat to themselves or others, see <A HREF="https://studentaffairs.umd.edu/health-wellness/concerned-about-student/student-concerned-student">this page for students concerned about another student</A>.
<P>

<strong>Anti-Harassment.</strong> The open exchange of ideas, the freedom of thought and expression, and respectful scientific debate are central to the aims and goals of this course. These require a community and an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group, that fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect, and that embraces diversity. Harassment and hostile behavior are unwelcome in any part of this course. This includes: speech or behavior that intimidates, creates discomfort, or interferes with a person’s participation or opportunity for participation in the class. We aim for this course to be an environment where harassment in any form does not happen, including but not limited to: harassment based on race, gender, religion, age, color, national origin, ancestry, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity.
<P>
Harassment includes degrading verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Please contact an instructor or staff member if you have questions or if you feel you are the victim of harassment (or otherwise witness harassment of others), or see <A HREF="https://ocrsm.umd.edu/">this page</A> for pointers to relevant resources.
Please note that as "responsible university employees" faculty are required to report any disclosure of sexual misconduct, i.e., they may not hold such disclosures in confidence. 
<A HREF="https://health.umd.edu/CARE">Campus Advocates Respond and Educate (CARE) to Stop Violence</A> provides free confidential (including anonymous) advocacy and therapy services to primary and secondary survivors of sexual assault, relationship violence, stalking, and sexual harassment; they are not  an official reporting entity but rather a resource that can help navigate options and provide connection to appropriate resources;
their General Information contact info is (301) 314-2222 (uhc-care@umd.edu) with a crisis cell contact number at (301) 741-3442.
The University of Maryland’s Sexual Misconduct Policy can be found <A HREF="https://policies.umd.edu/policy/bddc0b22-51b5-45b8-b37f-a1ddea14c7db/">here</A>.
<P>

<strong>Religious holidays.</strong> Please send the instructor a list of all holidays you observe during the semester <em>by the end of the first week of classes</em>, so they can be taken into account in the course schedule.
<P>

<strong>Emergency protocol.</strong> If the university is closed for an extended period of time, we will discuss how the course will be continued. (This used to be just a standard "it never happens" note on the syllabus, and then 2020 came along...)
<P>

<strong>Basic needs security.</strong> Any student who has difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or who lacks a safe and stable place to live, and believes this may affect their performance in this course, is encouraged to use the resources listed below for support. Students are better served and supported when such circumstances are shared with the professor. Please consider sharing your situation with your professor who may be able to assist you in finding the appropriate resources.
<ul> 
<p><li>Campus Pantry: Alleviates food insecurity and provides a safe space to distribute emergency food to current UMD students. Information is available at <A HREF="http://campuspantry.umd.edu/">http://campuspantry.umd.edu/</A>.
<p><li>Fostering Terp Success: A campuswide community of support and belonging for students who have a history of foster care involvement, are experiencing homelessness or housing insecurity, and lack a supportive family system.  See <A HREF="https://umd.edu/fostering-terp-success/resources">https://umd.edu/fostering-terp-success/resources</A>
<p><li>Student Crisis Fund: For students who have an unexpected critical situation and need immediate financial support. Students will be asked for basic information to describe their circumstances of the emergency need and what other sources of funds are available. For more information, visit <A HREF="https://sagiving.umd.edu/crisis/gethelp.html">http://www.crisisfund.umd.edu/gethelp.html</A>.
</ul>  
<P>
<strong>Use of student work.</strong>Your completed work may be used by me in this or subsequent semesters for educational purposes. Before making such use of your work, I will either get your written permission, or render the work anonymous by removing all your personal identification from the material.

<P>
<strong>Names and Pronouns.</strong>
Many people might go by a name in daily life that is different from their legal name. In this classroom, we seek to refer to people by the names that they go by. Pronouns can be a way to affirm someone's gender identity, but they can also be unrelated to a person's identity. They are simply a public way in which people are referred to in place of their name (e.g. "he" or "she" or "they" or "ze" or something else). In this classroom, you are invited (if you want to) to share what pronouns you go by, and we seek to refer to people using the pronouns that they share. The pronouns someone indicates are not necessarily indicative of their gender identity. Visit <A HREF="http://trans.umd.edu">trans.umd.edu</A> to learn more.

<P>
<strong>Right to change information.</strong>
Although every effort has been made to be complete and accurate, unforeseen circumstances arising during the semester could require the adjustment of any material given here. Consequently, given due notice to students, the instructor reserves the right to change any information on this syllabus or in other course materials.
