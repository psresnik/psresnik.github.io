"Timestamp","What do you consider your primary department(s)?","Optionally: your name (feel free to stay anonymous)","Which best describes you?","Which of these would you describe as your main area(s)?","Possibility 1: Computational social science.  If you look at my Fall 2020 seminar that will give you an idea of how I have approached this in the past, although given how rapidly things are moving on the computational side, I suspect that GPT-style large language models are going to play a more prominent part in our readings and discussions.  Partly in connection with that (thinking about the dialogue-oriented nature of ChatGPT, for example), I suspect that computational angles on pragmatics may also show up more visibly.","Possibility 2: Computational pragmatics.  This overlaps with my thinking on the computational social science seminar as above, but this version of things would be more focused (even while thinking of ""pragmatics"" pretty broadly).  There would need to be some review of basic concepts (since I won't assume everyone has taken Alexander's class) and then we'd look at the state of computational literature on the topic, probably including some older stuff (since I always think the historical context is important) but with an eye toward understanding the current state of affairs.","Possibility 3: Computational models of human parsing.  This would be an update of my Fall 2016 seminar, http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/ling848_fa2016/.  I imagine updating this will need some non-trivial updates, with interests in both large language models and probably also neuroscience-related discussion.","Are there any other computational linguistics topic areas you would be particularly excited about, as the focus of a Fall 2023 computational linguistics seminar? (Don't include a topic area in your response unless you're confident you would be interested in attending a seminar on that topic.)"
