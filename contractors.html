<H2>What is this page?</H2>

This page contains a list of contractors and other people who help
solve problems of home ownership in my vicinity of Maryland.  It's a
personal list based primarily on personal experience -- I think it's
always better to use someone for whom you've gotten a first-person
recommendation!  Almost all of these people were originally
recommended to me by someone I know; at most, by a friend of someone I
know.  (I will <strong>not</strong> add recommendations unless the
degrees-of-separation between the recommender and myself is 2 or
less.)  If "Recommended By" says "Philip", that means I've used them
myself.  <A HREF="http://www.checkbook.org/">Consumer's Checkbook</A>
is an on-line source with more extensive information on area
contractors.<P>

Although I've provided information here that's accurate to the best of
my ability, everything here is a matter of opinion and you should use
it at your own risk.  If you have comments you'd like to add
(especially negative experiences with anyone listed here!) please
contact me, and feel free to also send me recommendations (especially
for categories that are not represented here).<P>

Fritz is extremely professional, and this (large) company came well
recommended.  I also called two of the references they listed on their
proposal and got back entirely favorable comments.  They installed
central air and a new furnace for me and were everything one could
have expected.  The job was done on time, very cleanly, and everything
works great.  (I have to admit I get nervous when encountering this
kind of efficiency in people named "Fritz". ;->)

for 7 days, during which my house turned into an attic.)  I made them
come back, fix it for free, and give me a refund.  They did that, but
treated me like dirt during all their visits. (They told me I was

Becky had had one bad experience with Marlo, where they were months
overdue delivering a bedroom set, and kept stringing her along with
"next week" and "any day now".  Nonetheless, when we found exactly the
couch we wanted there, we decided to give them a shot, but we told
them we'd cancel the order if it wasn't delivered by a specific date.
They called and scheduled delivery just under the wire, and then, the
morning of the supposed delivery (!) we called to get the delivery
time and discovered that the items hadn't arrived after all and
someone had made a mistake in scheduling us.  Actual delivery date?
Well, they <em>thought</em> it would be in two weeks.  We cancelled the order
and I highly recommend avoiding them, even though they <em>show</em> decent
stuff at good prices.  We found an alternative place to buy a couch
(Hamilton Sofa) and it worked out very well.<P>

<UL>
<LI> <strong>Oak Post Furniture</strong>, Kensington/Rockville, Maryland <font color="red">WARNING!</font>
<BR>
What on earth is the problem with furniture stores delivering anywhere
near when they say they will deliver?  We found some furniture we
liked at Oak Post Furniture, placed an order, and were given an
estimated delivery date.  In response to my explicit question about
how "real" the date was, the sales guy told me it was not a guarantee,
but that it was a very conservative estimate and the furniture was
very likely to come in sooner.  Tick, tock... several weeks after the
estimated date, still no delivery.  I called on a Friday and told the
young woman at the other end of the phone that I would be canceling
the order if the furniture was not delivered on Monday.  On Monday I
called and spoke to the manager, who had apparently not been told
about my call on Friday.  (Apparently my telling a store rep that I
was likely to cancel a healthy-sized order didn't merit passing along
the message?)  He claimed I would receive a call on Tuesday or
Wednesday to schedule delivery on Thursday, and I told him that on
Thursday I would call him to either (a) thank him for the delivery or
to (b) cancel the order.  (It's obvious where this is going, right?)
Thursday I called, and he said.... that the furniture was on its way
to the warehouse, I only needed to wait a few days more, etc.  At that
point I got tired of "it'll be here any day now" and canceled the
order.  I was told the refund would appear on my credit card in 3-5
days.  A week later, guess who I had to call?  Yup, my credit card
company, to dispute the charges, which had of course not been removed.
From this point on, we certainly wouldn't touch Oak Post Furniture
with a ten foot pole.

These guys did my last move a few years back, which was truly a short
hop, being less than a mile!  They provided a guaranteed estimate,
which was based on the job rather than hourly, and they showed up on
time and did a very good job.  The only downside: they were unable to
get my bed out in one piece, and since it would have required 1-2
hours to disassemble and reassemble (gotta love Ikea furniture!), they
offered me a discount if I'd deal with the bed myself since they had
another job to get to soon after mine.  I was frankly unhappy at being
pressured to do this, but I suspected they'd be much, much more
careful if they were not feeling stressed and rushed, and I was right.
I can't fault them, though: they dealt honestly with a difficult
situation, gave me a great price, and did a really good job.  I'd
recommend them, andBonnie's
recommendation was truly glowing.  (Disassembling the
bed myself turned out to be not too big a deal, but the reassembly was
a nightmare...)  They also handled Becky's move flawlessly.

even if you don't care about it actually being physically sent until
tomorrow?  Go to News Express at 7700 Old Georgetown Rd, Bethesda
(301-951-5280); they're open Mon-Fri 7am-9pm, Sat and Sun 8am-7pm.
Someone I happened to be standing on line with there recently (never
mind why) told me she'd driven there from McLean, VA because nowhere
else in the entire DC area had she found someplace open later.
<P>
Note that if you look <A

the Web</A>, the hours for News Express are wrong; the hours above are from their
business card, as of September 2010.
