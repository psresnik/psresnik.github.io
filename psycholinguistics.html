<H2>Syntactic Disambiguation</H2>

The kinds of information used in on-line syntactic processing
decisions has long been a source of controversy.  We are investigating
a computational model of minimalist syntactic theory (e.g. Weinberg
and Berwick's paper of that title at the 1997 <A
HREF="http://www.ccp.uchicago.edu/cpl">Conference on Computational
Psycholinguistics</A>), and recently have begun looking into the role
of plausibility in on-line processing using eye-tracking methods.


<H2>Selectional Constraints</H2>

Researcher: <A HREF="http://umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/">Philip Resnik</A><P>

Language theorists have long noted that language places constraints on
the relationships between things being talked about, constraints that
are sometimes violated even when the surface form of a sentence is
perfectly valid.  These constraints are often referred to as
selectional preferences: a word is said to ``select for'' the kinds of
things with which it can be associated.  Chomsky's famous sentence
``Colorless green ideas sleep furiously'' violates a number of these
preferences --- for example, the verb 'sleep' selects for a subject
that is animate, which 'ideas' are not.

This research concerns the computational modeling of selectional
constraints, and the use of such models in (1) making predictions
about linguistic behavior, and (2) performing computational tasks such
as <A

<H2>Semantic Similarity</H2>

Researcher: <A HREF="http://umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/">Philip Resnik</A><P>

Evaluating semantic similarity and relatedness using network
representations is a problem with a long history in artificial
intelligence and psychology, dating back to the spreading activation
approach of Quillian (1968) and Collins and Loftus (1975).  Our work
is investigating the definition of a taxonomic <A

based on the notion of information content</A>, evaluated by how well
it approximates human similarity ratings, and the application of that
and related similarity measures in <A
