<title>Vote for Natural Language Processing Talks at SXSW!</title>

<h1>Vote for Natural Language Processing Talks at SXSW!</h1>


Ok, I suppose what I mean is, vote for <em>my</em> natural language processing talks at South by Southwest (SXSW),
a set of film, music, and geek-a-rrific "interactive" festivals and conferences held annually in Austin, Texas.  
<P>
South by Southwest has a great mix of different attendees and it's a
wonderful opportunity to get the word out about language technology,
so this year I've pulled out all the stops and I'm involved in several
proposals, each of which has its own distinct message.  Popular voting
counts for about 30% when proposals are selected, so your vote
matters!  (And yes, the organizers permit and even encourage
get-out-the-vote-for-yourself campaigns.)
<P>
<strong>The way this works:
<ul>  
<li>You get an account at
the <A HREF="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/" target="_blank">SXSW PanelPicker 2012</A>
site by going to
the <A HREF="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/users/register" target="_blank">Create an
Account</A> page, which takes all of about 30 seconds.  
<li> Then, go to
the link below that interests you, read through the full description,
and (I hope) give it a thumbs up where it says "Your Vote" (just under
the title).</strong>
</ul>
Better yet, go give a thumbs up for all of these talks!  At 30 seconds
apiece, that's a total of two minutes, devoted to an excellent cause.

<li> <A HREF="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/9466" target="_blank">Human
  Language Technology and Where it's Headed</A><br>  Jason Baldridge and
  I are aiming to give a fun, informative presentation on the state of
  the art in language technology, why these are such exciting times,
  and what's coming.  It's time the broader techie audience got an
  earful about why our field is so cool!
<P>
<li> <A HREF="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/10361" target="_blank">EHRs, NLP,
  and the Future of Clinical Narrative</A><br>  After decades of failed
  efforts to make medical records electronic, it now looks like
  electronic health records (EHRs)are finally on the verge of catching
  on in this country for real, thanks to government incentives for
  doctors who use them and, in a couple of years, penalties levied on
  the doctors who don't.  The problem in a nutshell: in a well
  intentioned drive toward standardization and normalization, the
  people creating EHRs are driving natural language out of the
  clinical record.  My goal in this talk is to raise awareness of the
  problem, and to show how natural language processing technology
  provides a solution.
<P>
<li> <A HREF="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/12908" target="_blank">Artificial
  Intelligence in Film and the Real World</A><br>  And now for something
  completely different: computer scientists proposing a presentation
  at a film festival?!  Lillian Lee and I thought it would be great
  fun to use portrayals of artificial intelligence in the movies as a
  springboard for helping non-techies understand what AI really is,
  and also to tell the artsy and business types about AI research
  involving films,
  e.g. <A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~nasmith/papers/joshi+das+gimpel+smith.naacl10.pdf" target="_blank">predicting
  box office revenues using early reviews</A>
  and <A HREF="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/llee/papers/chameleons.home.html" target="_blank">computational
  linguistics analysis of film scripts</A>.
</ul>
<P>
Finally, let me suggest you also vote for this
<A HREF="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/9610" target="_blank">really
interesting panel discussion including Mark Dredze</A>, focused on the
use of social media to improve healthcare.  Perhaps I risk shooting
myself in the foot by pointing folks to a proposal competing in one of
the same categories, but we NLP folks should be supporting each other!
