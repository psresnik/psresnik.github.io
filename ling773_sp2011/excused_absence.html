<h1>Official Policy for Excused Absence</h1>

Students claiming an excused absence must apply in writing and furnish
documentary support (such as from a health care professional who
treated the student) for any assertion that the absence qualifies as
an excused absence. The support should explicitly indicate the dates
or times the student was incapacitated due to
illness. Self-documentation of illness is not itself sufficient
support to excuse the absence. An instructor is not under obligation
to offer a substitute assignment or to give a student a make-up
assessment unless the failure to perform was due to an excused
absence.
