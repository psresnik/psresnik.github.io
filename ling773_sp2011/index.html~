<H2>What's the course about?</H2>

This is the second semester in our graduate sequence in
computational linguistics.  Students are assumed to have taken the
first semester (Ling723/CMSC723) or equivalent, and this class will
provide foundations for advanced seminars in computational
linguistics.  Students are expected to be able to know how to program,
and will exercise this ability periodically in homework assignments
and/or projects.
<P>
The topics we'll cover are intended to get students up to speed on
necessary background in order to understand and perform cutting-edge
research in natural language processing, which requires a strong
grounding in statistical NLP models and methods.  Some of the topics
are in the same areas as in Computational Linguistics I, but we will
go deeper.  As always, the syllabus is subject to revision; however,
it will follow Manning and Schuetze's textbook relatively closely at
least in early parts of the course.
<P>
Please feel free to contact me with any questions, and feel free to
suggest the course to anyone who might be interested.
<P>
See the <A HREF="syllabus.html">schedule of topics</A> for
class-by-class plans.


<H2>How will the course be graded?:</H2>

Students will be evaluated on their ability to <em>master the
content</em> of the material in the course and to <em>think
critically</em> about ideas presented to them.

<UL>
<LI> <STRONG>Exams (50%):</STRONG> There will be a midterm exam and a
  final exam.  CS MS comp grade (AI area) will be based entirely on
  the average of the two exams. Both will be take-home exams,
  and both might involve programming.<P>
<LI> <STRONG>Class assignments/projects (45%):</STRONG> There will be
  periodic homework assignments and/or projects that may involve
  on-paper exercises (e.g. walking through algorithms or
  calculations), hands-on programming, or analysis of data.
  Regular assignments will be graded on a high pass (100%), 
  low pass (50%), or fail (0%).<P>
<LI> <STRONG>Class participation (5%):</STRONG> Showing up for class,
  demonstrating preparedness, and contributing to class discussions.
  Of these, the last one matters most.  
  This assessment is mainly subjective. I include it in the grade
  because it's much better for everyone to have students engaged in
  questioning and discussion during class.  (Note: I am also
  considering creating a class blog, and requiring all students to
  post at least once or twice during the semester).<P>
<LI> <STRONG>Extra credit:</STRONG> There may be some extra credit
offered, either within assignments or as extra assignments. I may also
offer extra credit for attending the 
<A HREF="https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Events">Computational Linguistics Colloquium</A>
and turning in a one-page summary/discussion of the talk.
</UL>

<H2>Policy for Incomplete Work</H2>

<UL>
<LI> <strong>Late assignments</strong>.  If an assignment is late by
 up to 24 hours, the grade will be reduced by 10%.  By 48 hours, 20%.
 And so forth.  Exceptions can be discussed in cases of medical
 excuses, family emergencies, equipment failure, etc., but being busy
 is <em>not</em> a valid excuse, and the sooner you talk to me about a
 problem the better.  
 <P>
 There are several common problems I am
 <em>unlikely</em> to consider as valid reasons for failing to get
 work in on time.  These include (a) failure to manage your time
 properly, (b) discovering an assignment is harder than you expected
 it to be (see item a), and (c) losing code or data that should have
 been backed up, unless it's someone else's fault. 
 <P>
<LI> <strong>Late assignment exception</strong>.  Each student can ask
 to extend an assignment due date by 48 hours <strong>once</strong>
 during the semester, no questions asked, as long as the request takes 
place before the assignment is due.  (E-mailing the request at the time
the assignment is due, in place of turning in the assignment, is ok.)
 <P>
<LI> <strong>'Incomplete' as a grade</strong>.  I will not issue an
  'incomplete' as a grade except for serious, valid reasons, generally
  in the category of emergencies.  See above for some reasons I am
  unlikely to consider valid.  If you are having problems of any kind,
  please <strong>talk to me as soon as possible</strong>.

  from exams</A>.
