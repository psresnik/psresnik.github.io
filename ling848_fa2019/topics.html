<P><li> heeger - theory of cortical function. [Prediction is constantly taking place, but he models things as a dynamical system that is constantly optimizing a loss function that balances top down prediction, bottom-up evidence, and what he calls "prior drive". The loss function also includes parameters intended to capture the tradeoff between top-down and bottom-up so that, for example, external factors like attention can adjust for how you trade off between the two.]
