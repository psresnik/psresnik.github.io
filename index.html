<P>
<li> <strong>Overview.</strong>  I do research in <A HREF="http://www.aclweb.org/">computational
linguistics</A>, with interests in the application of
natural language processing techniques to practical problems 
and the modeling of human
linguistic processes. 
My general research agenda for language technology
is to improve the state of the art by finding the right balance
between data driven statistical modeling and the use of 
linguistic and expert domain knowledge, with the larger goal of obtaining a better scientific
understanding of human language itself.  
<P>
  I recently came across a quote I really liked in <em>Odalisque</em>, a book by one of my <A HREF="#books">favorite authors</A>, Neal Stephenson: 
  "Fame is a weed, but repute is a small, growing oak, and all we can do during our lifetimes is hop around like squirrels and plant acorns." That's what we do, plant acorns. Students, ideas, things we write or program. With luck, who knows, some may grow into tall trees, and others with luck will at least provide a little nourishment to fellow squirrels who encounter them.
<P>

<li> <strong>Current work.</strong> My current research is situated in two main areas. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT size="-1">

<strong>Computational social science.</strong>  
(Why? See my discussion of <A HREF="impact.html">research and social impact</A>.)
The key question I'm exploring: what can the signal available in language use tell us about underlying mental aspects of the speaker/author, such as their ideology, emotional state, or the presence of mental disorders?  My earlier work in this area has included topics such as sentiment analysis, persuasion, framing, and "spin", with interests in connections among lexical semantics, surface linguistic expression, and underlying internal state, as well as applications of unsupervised and semisupervised methods. These days from a linguistics perspective I'm less focused on lexical semantics, and more focused on computational pragmatics. From a methods perspective, I retain a longstanding interest in topic models, because of those models' interpretability and their ability to incorporate pre-existing knowledge as informative priors, plus like anyone else I'm interested in large language models -- though only as a useful tool, not as some grand answer to the question of how to achieve AI. (Although it may rapidly go out of date, to get some idea of my views see <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncxPB8iCPP0">this 2023 talk to a lay audience on what they should know about ChatGPT</A>.)
<P>
A primary application focus for me these days involves applying computational models to the identification of linguistic signal related to mental health. See my page about <A HREF="impact.html">research and social impact</A> for discussion and for a good overview of my angle on this see my invited talk, <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPtdy8EZHR0">Analyzing social media for suicide risk using natural language processing</A> (~30min), at the <A HREF="https://www.amazon.science/latest-news/on-demand-the-2021-aws-machine-learning-summit">AWS Machine Learning Summit</A>; my <A HREF="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Naturally-occurring-language-as-a-source-of-in-Resnik-Foreman/18667529426fc25b044cb24497bde7de41a278bf">article</A> with suicide prevention experts also helps to situate what I do in its broader context.  In addition to suicidology, a primary area of research in collaboration with computational and medical school colleagues involves computational methods for identifying signal related to  <A HREF="http://research.umd.edu/development/umd-umb-seed-grant-program/2016-grants">depression and schizophrenia</A>; you, dear reader, are invited to contribute data to this effort <A HREF="http://umd.ourdatahelps.org">here</A>.
<P>
In addition to research on computational methods, I've been trying hard to make progress on the ability of the wider computational community to work with sensitive mental health data, including creation of the <A HREF="http://legacydirs.umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/umd_reddit_suicidality_dataset.html">The University of Maryland Reddit Suicidality Dataset</A>, development of <A HREF="http://enclave.umd.edu">The UMD/NORC Mental Health Data Enclave</A> (a joint project with NORC at the University of Chicago sponsored in part by an <A HREF="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/about-us/news/resnik-carpuat-and-davis-receive-amazon-research-awards">Amazon AWS Machine Learning Research Award</A>), and serving as co-founder and multiple-time organizer for the <A HREF="http://clpsych.org">Workshops on Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology (CLPsych)</A>.  Many of those pieces were brought together in the <A HREF="https://clpsych.org/shared-task-2021/">2021 CLPsych Shared Task</A>, where teams worked on prediction of suicide attempts using sensitive social media data within the UMD/NORC enclave.  I also serve on the Scientific Advisory Committee for <A HREF="http://coleridge.org">the Coleridge Initiative</A>, a non-profit focused on data-driven policy decision-making, often involving sensitive data.
<P>
The other main area in which I'm applying these ideas is computational political science -- again see discussion on my page about <A HREF="impact.html">research and social impact</A>, and also take a look at some of my <A HREF="computational_politics">previous research</A>. Recently, I was engaged in work with students Alexander Hoyle, Pranav Goel, and Rupak Sarkar, and collaborator Kris Miler and SoRelle Gaynor, on <A HREF="https://www.cs.umd.edu/article/2020/09/philip-resnik-receives-nsf-grant-develop-computational-models-better-understand" target="_blank">co-decisions</A>, with the goal of using computational methods to better understand when and for what reasons individuals make the same versus different decisions.  
<P>
With the same students I also recently engaged in an <A HREF="https://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/nsf_rapid/">NSF RAPID project</A> focused on improving topic modeling methods for analysis of open-ended survey responses, with the more general and ambitious goal of revolutionizing survey methodology by making open-ends a first-class citizen in survey research. This work was tightly connected to the COVID-19 pandemic: it involved collaborating on COVID-related survey research using computational techniques with folks at CDC National Center for National Center for Healthcare Statistics, the Pandemic Crisis Response Coalition, NYU School of Nursing, and others. These days it has evolved into collaboration Frauke Kreuter and folks connected with UMD's Joint Program in Survey Methodology.

<A NAME="cognitive">
<strong>Computational psycholinguistics and neurolinguistics.</strong>
Over the past five years or so, I have been re-engaging more and more fully with my
longstanding interests in computational approaches to cognitive questions, including psycholinguistics and more recently the computational neuroscience of language.  
During my 2018-2019 sabbatical, I began getting up to speed on interests in computational cognitive neuroscience and in Fall 2019 I began working with postdoc <A HREF="http://conf.ling.cornell.edu/sbhattasali/">Shohini Bhattasali</A> on applying computational models to neuroimaging data in order to better understand the physical basis of language comprehension and contextual influences on language (mis)understanding, in the context 
of a <A HREF="https://csis.gmu.edu/pages/projects/ONR-MURI-Generating-Documents.html">MURI project</A> involving document understanding(Shohini is now on the Linguistics faculty at University of Toronto). I also collaborated with <A HREF="https://christianbrodbeck.net/">Christian Brodbeck</A> (along with <A HREF="http://bbi.umd.edu/faculty/lau">Ellen Lau</A> and <A HREF="http://bbi.umd.edu/faculty/simon">Jonathan Simon</A>) on <A HREF="https://elifesciences.org/articles/72056">neural representations of continuous speech and linguistic context</A>, using computational models as a way of expressing cognitive hypotheses.
I'm excited that these lines of work have begun to produce some interesting results, e.g. see <A HREF="https://aclanthology.org/2021.findings-acl.332.pdf">here</A> for recent work where Shohini and I introduced a new predictive measure, <em>topical surprisal</em>, and used it in an fMRI to map the neural bases of broad and local
contextual prediction during natural language comprehension. Right now I'm excited about new work with undergrad Chiebuka Ohams taking a serious look at predictive coding models and sentence understanding.
<P>
On the psycholinguistics side, I have long been interested in sentence processing and particularly the interaction of top-down prediction and bottom-up evidence; my paper on <A HREF="https://aclanthology.org/C92-1032.pdf">left-corner parsing and psychological plausibility</A> is an early example.  As I've ramped back up in psycholinguistics, my work has involved looking at the interactions between syntactically mediated compositional processes and broader context, for which vector space representations (yes, including "deep learning", see below) offer some interesting modeling tools.  Some initial papers related to this line of work include Ettinger, Phillips, and Resnik, <A HREF="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~nhf/papers/SemanticSpaces.pdf">Modeling N400 amplitude using vector space models of word representation</A> (CogSci 2016) and Ettinger, Resnik, and Carpuat, <A HREF="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N/N16/N16-1163.pdf">Retrofitting sense-specific word vectors using parallel text</A> (NAACL 2016). I also remain quite interested in the ways that ideas from (statistical) information theory may have a useful role to play in explaining why language works the way it does.  (This is an idea I first began exploring in my dissertation [<A HREF="pubs/resnik_dissertation.ps">ps</A>,
<A HREF="pubs/resnik_dissertation.pdf">pdf</A>], back in 1993, and in following years a variety of people like John Hale, Roger Levy, and Florian Jaeger, among others, have done very interesting work in the same spirit.)  My psycholinguistics interests have led to interesting, more recent  <A HREF="https://people.umass.edu/bwdillon/CUNY_2020_Abstracts/MULLER_Final_Manuscript.pdf">collaboration</A> with my colleague <A HREF="https://www.colinphillips.net/">Colin Phillips</A> and his student Hanna Muller, and Colin and I are now co-advising Linguistics PhD student <A HREF="https://sathvikn.github.io/">Sathvik Nair</A>, who's been doing some really interesting work on surprisal and reading-time data, plus some recent, very important work looking at whether the non-cognitive tokenization schemes widely used in large language models might be problematic when these models are used in cognitively oriented research; EMNLP Findings paper <A HREF="https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.752/">here</A>. (Also: folks who are interested in computational models and psycholinguistics should also be talking with <A HREF="http://ling.umd.edu/~nhf/">Naomi Feldman</A>.)
<P>
Finally, I believe there are interesting ways to connect these  cognitive modeling interests together with more application-oriented interests and particularly the computational social science interests discussed above.  For a very big-picture look at how I'm thinking about this, take a look at my invited talk,
<A HREF="https://slideslive.com/38929656/beyond-facts-the-role-of-framing-in-assessing-what-is-true">Beyond Facts: The Problem of Framing in Assessing What is True</A>, at the 2020 Fact Extraction and Verification workshop (FEVER 3).

Some additional areas of interest include:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT size="-1">
<P>
<strong>Deep learning and LLMs.</strong> I debated whether to include this here, because frankly I believe there is a <em>ton</em> of hype, many people got excited about so-called "deep learning" (a better term coined by Noah Smith is <A HREF="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/slides/acl-8-1-17.pdf">squash networks</A>) for the wrong reasons, and with the advent of large language models the problem has only gotten worse. That said, it's practically impossible to get away from this topic, and I'm supervising students who do things with these models, so let me say what I <em>do</em> find interesting about this line of work. First, notwithstanding the hype, LLMs are creating a renewed energy around fundamental scientific questions in AI that I care about, including the nature of cognitive representations, computational models of human sentence processing (see discussion of psycho- and neurolinguistics above), and the nature of the interactions between human/prior knowledge and knowledge acquired inductively from data.
Second, the generative nature of LLMs makes it possible to develop new ways of exposing and using implicit information that is <em>behind</em> explicitly communicated information (see mention of computational pragmatics above and <A HREF="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14583">this EMNLP 2023 paper</A> for some recent work I'm very excited about).
Third, in-context zero- or few-shot learning is an exciting new way to develop practical tools with astonishingly small amounts of training data, as long as you don't get sucked into all the hype.  Fourth... Actually, that's about all that comes immediately to mind. :)
In particular, there are legimate <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sciences_of_the_Artificial">"Sciences of the Artificial"</A> scientific questions to be asked about LLMs, but I'm not really interested in LLMs themselves as an object of study -- for example, questions about whether LLMs possess particular cognition-related abilities and how they accomplish cognition-like tasks leave me cold unless the answers either serve practical purposes or also clearly tell us something about human cognition. Given all that, I'd say that if you're a prospective student and you believe LLMs could be interesting in your research, be prepared to show me that you've thought about <em>why</em> they should interest us!

<strong>Clinical informatics.</strong> Since about 1999 I've been involved in natural language
processing for clinical documentation. I helped start up
CodeRyte, Inc.,
which became the nation's fastest growing provider of NLP solutions in healthcare (showing up in
 <A HREF="http://www.deloitte.com/us/fast500/">Deloitte's Technology
Fast 500</A> and
the <A HREF="http://www.inc.com/inc5000/profile/coderyte">Inc. 5000</A>
listings); the company was acquired in April 2012
by <A HREF="http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/Health-Information-Systems/HIS/">3M
Health Information Systems</A>.  I developed major pieces of the core
technology, helped build an excellent language technology team, and I
continued for a number of years after the acquisition to advise on technology development and strategic
direction.
Somewhere along the way, much to my surprise, I was listed at #82 on the <A
HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20121120202555/http://healthspottr.com/fh100">Future Health 100</A>, a list of
"the most creative and influential innovators working in healthcare today"
at <A HREF="http://healthspottr.com">healthspottr.com</A>. 
<P>
I don't do a great deal of academic research myself on medical records,
largely for reasons having to do with limited access to clinical data. The long-term crisis in data access for language-technology research on clinical data is the subject of what my wife calls my "Data Rant", which I have delivered for years in talks at venues including SXSW, the VA, NIH, and the National Academies. I've more or less given up on the idea of legal or policy changes that could help solve this problem, and instead I've been turning my attention to secure data enclaves as an alternative solution, the idea being to bring researchers to the data rather than disseminating the data out to researchers. This is the focus of the <A HREF="http://enclave.umd.edu">NORC/UMD Mental Health Data Enclave</A> project.  That said, I have recently begun collaborating with <A HREF="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/Goodman-Katherine/">Katherine Goodman</A> at the School of Medicine, who focuses on epidemiology and public health; we are working on applying machine learning and other prediction model approaches in electronic health records, currently with a focus on predicting whether patients are likely to be carrying antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.

<strong>Machine translation.</strong> 
I am no longer actively leading system development in machine translation,
but I collaborate with <A HREF="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~marine/">Marine Carpuat</A>
and students and remain strongly interested in multilingual modeling, e.g.
collaborating with <A HREF="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/">Jordan Boyd-Graber</A> on
multilingual topic modeling in context of the DARPA <A HREF="http://www.darpa.mil/program/low-resource-languages-for-emergent-incidents">LORELEI</A> research program. My own approach to MT generally focused on
ways of exploiting <A HREF="parallel/">parallel corpora</A> and linguistically informed
modeling. Leading the statistical MT efforts at UMD for some dozen years starting in 2003,
I'm pleased to have had a wonderfully productive group. 
My then-postdoc <A HREF="http://www3.nd.edu/~dchiang/">David
Chiang</A> (now faculty at Notre Dame) developed
<A HREF="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~dchiang/papers/chiang-acl05.pdf">Hiero</A>,
the first syntax-based system to demonstrate performance comparable to
then state-of-the-art statistical phrase-based MT systems (see <A
HREF="http://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/mt/mt05eval_official_results_release_20050801_v3.html">2005
NIST MT Evaluation results</A>), and I had the pleasure of working with a number of
students to further improve hierarchical phrase-based translation, 
with some innovations including the introduction of lattice
decoding (useful in translation of speech recognition output and also
for text translation of morphologically complex languages),
development of efficient algorithms for using suffix array
representations in hierarchical decoding, use of
English-to-English translation to create artificial reference
translations for use in parameter tuning, the introduction of soft syntactic 
constraints based on source language structure, and exploitation of 
lattices and forests to represent source language paraphrase and
syntactically driven reordering alternatives.

<P>
<strong>Crowdsourcing and translation.</strong> 
Connected with machine translation research, <A HREF="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~bederson/">Ben Bederson</A> and I 
made an ambitious attempt at progress toward low cost, high quality translation by taking advantage of 
<em>monolingual</em> human participants in a computer-assisted translation protocol, in a project we called
"Translation as a Collaborative Process".  This blended ideas from machine translation, human computer-interfaces, and
distributed human computation ("crowdsourcing"), and tackled the real-world problem of translating books
in the <A HREF="http://en.childrenslibrary.org">International Children's Digital Library</A>.  We received a
2009 <A HREF="http://research.google.com/university/relations/research_awards.html">Google Research Award</A> sponsoring
this work, as well as funding from NSF.  In September 2009, Ben gave a <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMj1PnrZphg">
Google tech talk</A> about the project which is available on <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMj1PnrZphg">YouTube</A>.
With a follow-up Google Research Award we collaborated with  <A HREF="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ccb/">Chris
 Callison-Burch</A> to bring his crowdsourcing work and ours together in a framework we called "Translate the World".
Although I'm no longer currently active with this line of research, I remain quite interested in thinking about the 
machine translation problem more broadly than just a machine taking a chunk of text in and spitting a chunk of text out:
I think there is a great deal of untapped potential in thinking about the underlying <em>need</em> that MT 
serves, which is to produce understanding of language input in another language in ways that are cost-effective, available when you need them, and good enough for the task at hand.

Continued interests in multilingual NLP include using parallel
bilingual text to improve
<A HREF="http://www.senseval.org/">word sense disambiguation</A> (that
is, the identification of appropriate word meanings in context),
exploiting linguistic information to improve word-to-word alignments
between translations, and developing parsers for resource-poor
languages by projecting linguistic information from English, using a
parallel corpus as a bridge from one language to the other.

<strong>Empirical linguistics.</strong>
I'm quite interested in promoting the use of naturally occurring data as evidence
in linguistics research.  I led the development of the <A
HREF="http://lse.umiacs.umd.edu/">Linguist's Search Engine</A>, a tool
designed to make it easier for linguists to search naturally occurring
data using syntactic and lexical criteria.  This tool was intended to
make it easier for more linguists to go beyond the exclusive use of
introspective judgments as empirical evidence, <A
HREF="pubs/bls2005.pdf">which can lead to useful and interesting
results</A>.  In follow-on work with the <A
HREF="http://www.casl.umd.edu/">Center for the Advanced Study of
Language (CASL)</A>, we ported the LSE to Chinese, and the LSE code is
available under an open source license.  (<A
HREF="http://umiacs.umd.edu/~aelkiss">Aaron Elkiss</A> was the LSE's
chief architect, implementor, and guru.  I kept it running for a number of years
after he graduated, but eventually retired it.  Anyone interested in 
resurrecting it: the source code is available.)

<H2>Professional History</H2>


<UL>
<LI> I am (since September 1996) a member of the <A
HREF="http://www.ling.umd.edu/">Linguistics</A>
faculty at the <A HREF="http://www.umcp.umd.edu">University of
Maryland, College Park</A>, with a 50-50 joint appointment at the <A
HREF="http://umiacs.umd.edu/">University of Maryland Institute for
Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS)</A>.   My official title is MPower Professor.  I am
also an affiliate professor in the <A
HREF="http://www.cs.umd.edu/">Department of Computer Science</A>.
<P>
<ul>
<li> In 2022 I was designated <A HREF="https://www.umiacs.umd.edu/about-us/news/resnik-selected-prestigious-mpower-professorship">MPower Professor</A>, as part of the <A HREF="https://mpower.maryland.edu/">University of Maryland MPower Strategic Partnership</A>. MPower recognizes and fosters collaboration between UMD College Park and the University of Maryland Baltimore, and this designation is in connection with my collaborations at the School of Medicine.
</ul>
<P>

<LI> I spent academic year 2011-2012 focusing primarily on the development of a new mobile and highly scalable approach to collecting real-time responses, motivated largely by the desire to obtain accurate and high quality data to people's reactions to framing in political discourse. This led to data collection of real-time responses from thousands of viewers watching the Obama/Romney debates in Fall 2012 and to the creation of <A HREF="https://s3.amazonaws.com/app.reactlabs.org/dotcom/index.html">React Labs</A>, a company commercializing the technology.
<P>

<LI> I spent academic year 2003-2004 on 
<a href="sabbatical.html">sabbatical</a> at Johns Hopkins University,
focusing on machine translation and on some interesting work related
to child language acquisition.
<P>

<LI> I spent parts of May and August 2001 as a visiting
 researcher at the spoken language processing group of
 <A HREF="http://www.limsi.fr/indexgb.html">LIMSI-CNRS</A>
 (Orsay, near Paris), working with <A
 HREF="http://www.limsi.fr/Individu/pap/">Patrick Paroubek</A>
 on automatic processing of medical research articles to help identify 
 synonymous gene identifiers.<P>
<LI> I spent January 2000 as a visiting professor in <A
HREF="http://www.ccr.jussieu.fr/p7/ufr/ufr10.html">Linguistics</A> at
the <A HREF="http://www.sigu7.jussieu.fr/">University of Paris
7</A>.
<P> 

<LI> After finishing my doctorate I spent 3 years as a research
scientist at <A HREF="http://www.sunlabs.com/">Sun Microsystems
Laboratories</A>, near Boston, Massachusetts.  Arriving at Sun Labs in
October 1993, I spent much of my time there working on the <A
HREF="http://www.sunlabs.com/research/knowledge/">Conceptual
Indexing</A> project (which got a <A
HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/20030608225920/http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/96apr/computer/computer.htm">nice
writeup</A> in the April 1996 issue of <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>).  I
also started up a project looking at <A
HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/19991003141412/http://www.sunlabs.com/research/ila/">multilingual issues on the
World Wide Web</A>, in collaboration with Gary Adams.
<!-- http://www.w3.org/Search/9605-Indexing-Workshop/Papers/Resnik@Sun.html -->
One result of this was United States Patent 6,615,168 awarded to
Resnik, et al., September 2, 2003:
<A HREF="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=/netahtml/srchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=6,615,168.WKU.&OS=PN/6,615,168&RS=PN/6,615,168">Multilingual agent for use in computer systems</A>.
<P>


<LI> I did my Ph.D. in <A HREF="http://www.cis.upenn.edu">Computer and
Information Science</A> at the <A
HREF="http://www.upenn.edu">University of Pennsylvania</A>.  I spent
most of my time at Penn at the <A
HREF="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ircs/homepage.html">Institute for
Research in Cognitive Science</A> (IRCS), a truly wonderful
interdisciplinary environment.  
My dissertation received the 1994 <A
HREF="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/undergraduate/student-life/awards.php">Rubinoff Award</A>.
<P>

<LI> I spent the summer of 1991 working at IBM's <A
HREF="http://www.watson.ibm.com/">T.J. Watson Research Center</A>,
resulting in my being included as co-inventor on Patent 5,267,345,
issued November 30, 1993, 
<A HREF="http://www.delphion.com/details?pn=US05267345__">"Speech
recognition apparatus which predicts word classes from context and
words from word classes"</A>, with co-inventors Peter Brown, Stephen
Della Pietra, Vincent Della Pietra, Robert Mercer, and Stanley Chen.
(Not long after that, all the co-inventors except Stan Chen moved on 
from language technology to <A HREF="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-21/how-renaissance-s-medallion-fund-became-finance-s-blackest-box">rather greener pastures</A>.
<P>

<LI> Before going back for my Ph.D. at Penn, I worked for two years as
a research scientist at <A HREF="http://www.bbn.com">Bolt Beranek and
Newman</A> (BBN) in the area of language
understanding</A>.
<P>

<LI> And before BBN, I was an undergraduate at <A

I concentrated in <A HREF="http://cs.harvard.edu/">Computer 
Science</A>.

<H2>The Rest</H2>

<UL> 

<LI> First on the list of important things in my life would have to be
my family: <A HREF="https://benresnik.com/">Ben</A> (that's a current place to go; and
here's a <A HREF="ben/index_2003.html">home page</A> he created many years ago,
preserved for sentimental reasons), my incredibly
wonderful wife, <A
HREF="http://www.resnikpsychology.com/staff/dr-rebecca-resnik/">Rebecca</A> (who is, among other accomplishments, founder and director of <A HREF="http://resnikpsychology.com">Rebecca Resnik and Associates</A>), and our sons
Harry and Jay, not to mention <A HREF="delilah">Delilah</A> and <A HREF="remy">Remy</A>.
(We also have fond memories of <A HREF="annie">Annie</A>.) 
<!--
<P>
As of May 2015, major congratulations to Rebecca for transforming Mindwell Psychology Bethesda (originally co-founded with Rachna Varia and Kristi Guadagnoli of Mindwell Psychology in Chantilly) into <A HREF="http://resnikpsychology.com">Rebecca Resnik and Associates</A>, a new practice of which she is founder and director, now fully independent of Mindwell Chantilly.
-->
<P>
<LI> I am, believe it or not (sometimes I don't), a Sunday school
music teacher, at
<A HREF="http://www.bethchai.org/">Beth Chai</A>, the The Greater
Washington Jewish Humanist Congregation.  Beth Chai is a lovely
community of people from all over the D.C. area.  (Short summary of the congregation's approach, as an equation: <font face="courier">Humanistic_Judaism = Judaism &mdash; Supernatural</font>.)
<P>
<LI> During a wonderful several years of exercising consistently, I worked my way up to an advanced brown belt in Thai Kickboxing.
(Just in case the Sunday School approach doesn't solve all my
problems, you know? :->) I learned many <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74Iw_Mt8NM4">challenging
moves</A>.  I got back to it after a several year hiatus, and then managed to do some bad things to my knees
that the kickboxing aggravated.  Sadly, a return to kickboxing is not in the cards, and a transition to running stopped when my knees stopped cooperating. These days I row (indoors), bike, and I play ultimate frisbee on the weekends whenever I can at a pick-up game where my devilish cleverness and awesome field sense make up for the fact that I mostly walk rather than run (or at least it's a pick-up game where the other folks are willing to put up with me in that regard). What's pretty cool these days is that Harry and Jay play also.
<P>

<LI> In 2000 I became a homeowner.  Eeek!  Then in 2006 we moved to a new house (and spent quite a while
trying to sell the old one, sigh, though it ended happily).  To get an idea what the joys of
home ownership are like, take a look at my 
<A HREF="contractors.html">Home Problem Solving</A> page, though note that it's no longer maintained actively and hasn't been for a really long time.
<P>

<LI> Other goings on... I've been interested in swing and ballroom
dance since taking some <A
HREF="http://web.mit.edu/bdclub/">classes at
MIT</A> and even, once upon a time, competing at the <OLD_IGNORE
HREF="http://hcs.harvard.edu/~hrbdc/announce/comp96.html"> Fifth
Annual Harvard Ballroom Dance Team Invitational
Competition</OLD_IGNORE>.  (Newcomer category, made the quarter finals
in East coast swing and managed not to embarass either my partner or
myself at tango and foxtrot.)  Here's a probably outdated, somewhat
personalized <A HREF="dancing.html">list of useful dancing sites</A>
in the D.C. area created before Harry and Jay were born, when
having a handy list of dancing sites was connected with actually going
out dancing.  That's another thing I'm hoping we'll get back to at some point...
<P>
<LI> I came across an old dance acquaintance on the Web,
helping illustrate <A HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/20040202000531/http://dancestore.com/anna/anna.html">why I like lindyhop</A>.  :-)
<P>
<!-- <LI> I occasionally (these days <em>very</em> occasionally) play in
the semi-regular, never predictable linguistics department soccer
game.  Check out the photographic record of one of our
<A HREF="http://www.ling.umd.edu/PhotoAlbum/">

Ben getting smooshed by the guy in the blue shirt.  (Believe me, he
deserved it.) <P> -->

<LI> In 1986 I sang at the 40th anniversary concert of the
<A HREF="http://hcs.harvard.edu/~kroks">Harvard Krokodiloes</A>, a
12-man <i>a capella</i> singing group founded in 1946 of which I am an alumnus.  I've 
also sung at the 50th anniversary concert, the 60th, and I sang in
<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fj-_t3CO8AI">the Kroks' 70th anniversary concert</A>, too.
Boy, all that time sure goes by fast.
<P>

<LI> Once upon a time I took a rather interesting trip with Doug Oard to New Orleans for
Mardi Gras, and wrote up <A HREF="new_orleans.html">some of my
adventures</A>.
<P>

<LI> Check out <A HREF="http://www.echelman.com/"> artist Janet
Echelman's Web page</A>. I'm pleased to have helped put together her
original, very first page, years ago in the dark ages when Janet was a Web novice.
She's now <A HREF="https://www.echelman.com/press">world famous</A> and happily has long since acquired the ability to actually hire people who know what they're doing.<P>

<LI> It's pretty wild that it's possible to track ancient history all the way back to <A HREF="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!search/presnik/sci.research/fTLz6POu_kQ/CEEOieOs7v0J">the earliest record I could find of a post I made on the Internet</A>.

<P>

<LI> Quite some time back, I added a bullet recommending that people
check out <A
HREF="http://umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/annies_census_song.html">Annie's
Census Song</A>, a trifle of satire written by a dear friend, author
and screenwriter <A HREF="http://www.nicolegalland.com">Nicki
Galland</A>, in a mad fit of boredom.  I wrote, "Nicki is much busier
these days, having published a well received first novel entitled <A
HREF="http://www.nicolegalland.com/synopsis_ft.htm">The Fool's
Tale</A>; then a second novel (<A
HREF="http://www.nicolegalland.com/synopsis_rr.htm">Revenge of the
Rose</A>, which came out in August 2006). Go hunt for Nicki's most recent stuff because 
she keeps on producing good things, including work co-authored with Neal Stephenson, one of my other favorite authors.
<P>

<LI> Photo for a neat <A HREF="akimitsu.jpg">science fair project</A> for which
  I helped provide a few pointers.  (How many 7th graders do you know

<P>
<a name="books">    
<LI>  A few favorite books, ones that I revisit every few years once
      they are "ripe" for re-reading...<P>
 <ul>
 <li>  Mark Helprin, <em>Winter's Tale</em>
 <li>  Peter S. Beagle, <em>A Fine and Private Place</em>
 <li>  Orson Scott Card, <em>Ender's Game</em>
 <li>  William Goldman, <em>The Princess Bride</em>
 <li>  Frances Hodgson Burnett, <em>The Lost Prince</em>
 <li>  Margaret Atwood, <em>The Handmaid's Tale</em> (Are we there yet?)
  <ul> 
  <li> I added the parenthetical comment many years ago, semi-joking. Little did I know...
  </ul>
 <li>  Neal Stephenson, <em>Cryptonomicon</em>
 <li>  Lawrence Block, <em>The Triumph of Evil</em> (a little known gem)
 <li>  Stephen King, <em>The Stand</em>
  <ul> 
  <li> Read the version that was published in 1978, Do not, repeat <em>do not</em> read the "complete and uncut" edition, or at least don't start with it. They added the cut material back in after he was famous, and it's just not as good a book.
  </ul>
 <li>  George Orwell, <em>1984</em>
 <li>  Faber and Mazlish, <em>How to Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So
    Kids Will Talk</em>
  <ul> 
  <li> Those who know me well, and some who don't, will know that I am positively evangelical when it 
    comes to this book. It is not just for parents. It will improve every relationship in your life. Read it.

Formal/logic-based methods for representing and composing language; computational linguistics with a focus on healthcare data/problems or misinformation/network-type detection problems (haha, sorry, I know these are probably too specific!)
Would like to emphasize interest in Computational Social Science, especially how language is susceptible to propagating all types of bias and how computational linguistics and/or NLP can help in the fight against oppressive hierarchical systems in our society and help us move towards equality and equity.
Nope, hope you are doing well!
