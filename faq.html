<H1>FAQ for Prospective Advisees</H1>

I am lucky enough to receive fairly frequent e-mail from folks who
express an interest in working with me.  If you are such a person,
thank you for your interest!  However, <strong>before contacting
me</strong>, please read <strong>all</strong> the information below.  And then, if you
decide to write, <strong>please tell me that you have read my
FAQ</strong>; otherwise my first response, if I send one, will be to
send you here.

I hope this FAQ is helpful. For prospective Ph.D. students, I'd also
like to recommend this nice article
on <A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rap/grads.html">choosing a
Ph.D. program in Computer Science</A>, which contains a lot of
information applicable to other disciplines, as well. 
For a much more general and comprehensive discussion of graduate
school and life in academia, I recommend Cynthia Verba,
<A HREF="http://www.gsas.harvard.edu/images/stories/pdfs/scholarly_pursuits.pdf">Scholarly
Pursuits: A Guide to Professional Development During the Graduate
Years</A>, which is old but still quite useful.

I recognize that some people come from a culture where these modes of address are the natural way to approach a professor. However -- and I'm sorry to be strict about this -- I will <em>immediately delete</em>
any e-mail inquiries that are not addressed to me personally (that is, explicitly using my name), since those often indicate that I am part of a bulk e-mail.

<P>
<strong><em>Please do not send me email to ask this question or any of the related questions listed below.</em></strong>  If you're considering applying for grad school at UMD, that's wonderful, and I appreciate your interest in working with me. However, there are too many factors involved for me to know the answer to this question myself at the time you will be writing it, and please trust me that emailing me just to tell me that you're applying will make absolutely no difference.
<P>
That said, if you apply you are more than welcome to mention me in your application as a potential advisor and to talk about how your research vision fits with my own interests.  Though, CS applicants, please make sure to read this <A href="#applicant">important note</A>.

<P>
I'm interested in prospective Linguistics or CS students who have 
<strong>strong computational skills</strong>, <strong>a deep interest in human language</strong>, and who <strong>care about the problems they work on</strong>.
<P>
In general, looking at  <A HREF="pubs.html">my recent publications</A> will help you get a sense of what I do and how I approach things.
At the present time, I am most interested in students who are interested in one of the following problem areas. If you decide to apply, don't just tell me you're interested in one or more of these areas; tell me what interests you about them, how you are thinking of approaching the topic, and of course tell me about any relevant research experience.
<P>
<ul>

<p><li> <strong>Computational psycholinguistics and neurolinguistics.</strong> Although language processing has long been a subject I'm interested in, I've also been looking in recent years at connections, and the lack of connection, between computational linguistics and modern computational neuroscience. Take a look at the questions that I asked in my 2019 <A HREF="ling848_fa2019/">seminar on topics in the computational cognitive neuroscience of language</A>, at my 2022 <A HREF="ling848_sp2022/"> seminar on computational cognitive neuroscience and AI, and particularly at the discussion of my <A HREF="index.html#cognitive">current work</A> on these topics. If what you see there relates to questions you're interested in, tell me what those are and how you're thinking of approaching them.

<p><li> <strong>Computational approaches to mental health.</strong>  I am working on development of computational methods in connection with mental health conditions, particularly suicide risk, schizophrenia, and depression, and I am particularly interested in better prediction for early detection or monitoring, effective use of both data and domain knowledge, integration of machine and human capabilities, and improving our scientific understanding of the conditions themselves.  I am <em>not</em> interested simply in throwing off-the-shelf machine learning methods at mental health data, so so if this is an area that interests you, tell me more about your research vision.

<p><li> <strong>Computational political science.</strong>  I am particularly interested in how language influences and/or reflects our perspectives and decision making.  Most of my work on that topic has tended to involve political actors (e.g. presidential candidates, Congress, members of the Supreme Court), with some attention to public attitudes and responses. But I'm increasingly interested in better understanding the way public perceptions are influenced, or even constructed, by language, as well as the language-oriented and psychological factors that make people susceptible to being manipulated by misleading or false information. If you have a vision of research along these lines let me know what it is.
</ul>
<P>
<em>If you are from a low-income, first generation, or traditionally underrepresented group in academia, or in computer science and/or linguistics in particular, I invite (indeed, encourage) you to let me know, if that information would not otherwise be apparent to me.</em>
<P>

<!--
I'm pretty open minded about potential topics, but the following are the areas for
which I am most likely to be taking new students.  
<ul> 
<li>  <strong>Computational social science</strong>.  Computational methods are providing new ways to understand social
      phenomena, often fueled by the increasing availability 
      of what <A HREF="http://gking.harvard.edu/files/LazPenAda09.pdf">David Lazer et al. (2009)</A> 
      describe  as "digital traces that can be compiled into comprehensive pictures of
      both individual and group behavior, with the potential to transform our understanding of our
      lives, organizations, and societies."   
      My own particular angle has to do with computational approaches to the relationship between observable language   
      and underlying mental state, which can include properties such as sentiment and perspective, political ideology, and 
      mental conditions such as depression.  In the political science domain, I'm
      particularly interested in notions such as framing and "spin", and I'm also engaged in work with 
      clinical psychologists looking at potential linguistically observable signals related to 
      personality and mental health conditions.   
      <P> 
      To convey a bit about how I approach these topics, a few relevant papers include:

<P>
<li> <strong>Machine learning and modeling</strong>.  
 I consider myself a computational linguist involved in machine learning, not a machine learning 
 researcher or modeler <em>per se</em>, 
 but good learning and modeling are a central part of my approach these days and I very much like working 
 with strong collaborators and students taking these approaches.
 Bayesian topic models have proven to be a very attractive framework for doing a lot of the kinds of work I'm interested in
 (e.g. see the great dissertation by <A HREF="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~vietan/">Viet-An Nguyen</A>, 
 with Jordan Boyd-Graber and me as co-advisors)
 though I'm not wedded to them (e.g. I advised <A HREF="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~vlad/">Vlad Eidelman</A>'s excellent recent
 dissertation on  learning for large-scale and complex structured prediction problems). 
 I have <A HREF="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/static/home.html">some</A> <A HREF="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/">great</A>
     <A HREF="http://ling.umd.edu/~nhf/">colleagues</A> who know an awful lot about machine learning and modeling 
 and are wonderful to collaborate with.  
<P>
And yes, like everyone else these days, I'm finding myself looking seriously at deep learning/representation learning, including working with some students who are using it. I believe the current renaissance in dimensionality-reduced distributed representations is producing many useful ideas and tools, though personally I'm deeply (sorry!) skeptical of some researchers' rather ideological claims that deep learning is the ultimate solution to everything. For a very useful discussion see Chris Manning's article, <A href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/COLI_a_00239">Computational Linguistics and Deep Learning</A>.
<P>
<li> <strong>Computational psycholinguistics</strong>.  
      I am very interested in the potential connections
      between my social science interests and linguistic/cognitive biases.
      (Teaser question...President Ronald Reagan famously said "Mistakes were made", and 
      my 6-year-old has been known more than a few times to say "Daddy, my toy broke". What
      do the two have in common? See <A HREF="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N09-1057">this paper</A> for an answer.)
      More broadly, I think work by my Linguistics faculty
      colleagues <A HREF="http://ling.umd.edu/~nhf/">Naomi
      Feldman</A>,
      <A HREF="http://ling.umd.edu/~ellenlau/">Ellen Lau</A>,
      and <A HREF="http://ling.umd.edu/~colin/">Colin Phillips</A> is
      incredibly cool and holds the potential for some very interesting
      collaborations.
<P>
      In addition, I have a longstanding interest in the
      application of information-theoretic ideas to online
      comprehension and generation, and the possibility that
      information-theoretic constraints have a role to play in
      characterizing the nature of natural language grammars.  I've
      been thinking about this since my dissertation
      [<A HREF="pubs/resnik_dissertation.ps">ps</A>, <A HREF="pubs/resnik_dissertation.pdf">pdf</A>],
      and on this topic I'm quite interested in recent work by people
      like <A HREF="http://idiom.ucsd.edu/~rlevy/">Roger
      Levy</A>, <A HREF="http://www.bcs.rochester.edu/people/fjaeger/">Florian
      Jaeger</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.msu.edu/~jthale/">John
      Hale</A>.  
<P>
<li>  <strong>Statistical machine translation</strong>.  Our lab has a strong track record in statistical MT, and I work 
      with other faculty interested in MT including 
      my colleagues <A HREF="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~marine/">Marine Carpuat</A> and 
      <A HREF="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/">Hal Daum&eacute; III</A>.
      Although I'm very proud of the accomplishments in my group in what one might think of as "core" MT (as just two examples,
      David Chiang's introduction of <A HREF="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/coli.2007.33.2.201">Hiero</A>
      and Chris Dyer's <A HREF="http://cdec-decoder.org/">cdec</A> as new and influential MT frameworks), 
      my personal interests have evolved away from a focus on engineering linguistically relevant features into
      conventional SMT systems, and more toward the connections that MT can have to semantics (including distributional
      semantics) as well as the broader
      goal of available, cost-effective translation that meets real-world needs. As an example of the latter was
      in a fascinating collaboration with <A HREF="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~bederson/">a 
      leading expert in human-computer
      interaction</A>,  co-advising a dissertation in which student Chang Hu looked at  
      <A HREF="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/monotrans/">crowdsourcing translation
      without bilinguals</A>; Philip Resnik, Olivia Buzek,

  <P>
  I'm happy to talk about collaboration with grad students in other departments, as long as 
  their advisors are engaged or at least on board. That's different from advising ---
  I generally do not take on research advisees whose main focus is
  outside of computational linguistics. If you want to do work that is aligned with my current research interests,
  and you have already
  taken relevant coursework <em>and are seriously interested in

<li> <strong>Can I work with you on a Ph.D. in computational
linguistics or natural language processing?</strong> <a href="#questions"><font size="tiny">[back to top]</font></a>
<P>
<strong>The only way to get an answer to this question is to apply to a
Ph.D. program here.</strong> And before reading further, please see <A HREF="#vacancies">this question</A> and how I answered it.
<P>
In general, students who work with me have a
strong background in computer science, as well as  exposure to
natural language processing, linguistics, or both.  
The ideal student for me in the Linguistics Department
tends either to be a strong computer scientist who is so in love with
language that they want the degree in Linguistics rather than CS,
or someone coming from the cognitive science side (e.g. Linguistics, 
Psychology) who already has significant experience with computational work,
at minimum someone who  already has some degree of comfort with programming (typically Python).
<P>
An important thing to note: UMD does not offer degrees
specifically in computational linguistics or NLP.  Students interested
in these topics typically enroll in the Ph.D. program in either <A
HREF="http://ling.umd.edu">Linguistics</A>, <A
HREF="http://www.cs.umd.edu">Computer Science</A>, or at the <A
HREF="http://ischool.umd.edu">iSchool</A> (i.e. College of Information
Studies).  (See also the <A HREF="https://nacs.umd.edu/">Neural and Cognitive Science program</A>.)
Each of those programs offers information for
prospective students on its Web page.  I have advised or co-advised
students from all of them.
<P>

Regardless of department, the strongest applicants will have an
established track record in computational linguistics research,
e.g. co-authorship on papers published at first-tier conferences.
That said, it is often the case that people from low-income, first
generation, or traditionally underrepresented groups have not had as
many opportunities for these experiences, so <em>if you are a member of one of those groups, 
I invite (indeed, encourage) you to let me know, if that information would not otherwise be apparent to me.</em>


<P>
Please see <A HREF="#research">this question and answer</A> for information about research areas that I'm interested in.</A>
<P>
<em>
<A name="csapplicant">
<strong>An important note for Computer Science applicants:</strong>  <a href="#questions"></a>
<P>
The CS department here will often admit strong students regardless of
whether or not they are matched in advance with a specific advisor.
For many (even most) students in CS, the first year (or sometimes two
years) involves a "shopping around" process where students get to know
potential advisors and vice versa.  So <em>getting admitted to CS at University of Maryland isn't
the same as getting admitted to work with a particular advisor, even if that advisor
was mentioned in your application</em>. If you are admitted to CS and want to work with me, 
it's essential to contact me directly before you make your acceptance decision, so that we can talk about it.

<!-- I don't mind at all if you'd like 
to get in touch ahead of time with your c.v. and a description of your 
interests, especially if you're planning to mention me in your application,
<strong>
but please don't ask me to write back commenting on your qualifications 
(read <A HREF="#qualifications">this</A>)
or your chances of becoming my advisee
(also read <A HREF="#vacancies">this</A> and  <A HREF="#chances">this</A>).
-->
</strong>
</em>
<P>

<A name="qualifications">
<li> <strong>Are my qualifications appropriate?  What can I do to improve them?</strong> <a href="#questions"><font size="tiny">[back to top]</font></a>
<P>
Regarding qualifications, as I noted above, I am most interested in
students who have both a strong computational background and a deep
interest in human language.  I can potentially co-advise students who
have just one of these or the other, depending on who the other co-advisor is.
<P>
I am sometimes asked by undergraduates interested in computational
linguistics what courses they should take, prior to grad school
applications, to better prepare themselves.  First of all, bravo!
That's a good question to be asking, especially if you're asking it
early enough to do something about it.  In order of priority, I think
the areas below are probably where you should focus on the computational side.
<p>
(Note also that I'm a really big fan of the <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw">3Blue1Brown</A> videos on YouTube, and I very highly recommend you look there for material related to some of these topics. The sequences on <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab">linear algebra</A>, <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr">calculus</A>, and <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi">neural networks</A> are particularly good and I recommend them even if you're already familiar with the material.)
  <ul>
  <li> Programming.  Programming is more a skill than a body of
  knowledge you can learn from a book, so the sooner you start
  practicing the better.  In terms of specific programming languages,
  these days Python is dominant in NLP and machine learning, and the
  popular <A HREF="http://www.nltk.org/">Natural Language Toolkit</A>
  and its associated book are a good way to get exposed to both
  programming basics and NLP concepts, although for NLP
  packages <A HREF="https://spacy.io">spaCy</A> would be my go-to when
  it comes to something industry strength. R is very popular for
  statistical modeling, particularly in the social sciences, and there
  are R wrappers around some useful python packages.  Perl has fallen
  out of favor, but it can still be very good for down-and-dirty text
  processing and it's particularly worth learning as a value-add if
  you already are fluent in major *nix command-line tools like awk and
  sed.  Java is still popular, though in my opinion it requires too
  much overhead to learn compared to the value it provides, except
  perhaps in those industry settings where the company requires it.
  Scala seems to be an up-and-comer for people who like Java. The
  basics of UIs in javascript can be very useful, especially if you
  actually use jQuery to simplify your life.  I'd say C and C++
  probably shouldn't be your first choice.
  <P>
  <li> Basic probability and statistics.  
  These should be part of <em>everyone's</em> education.  How else can
  you understand what's going on in the economy, make informed
  decisions about medical treatments, or choose the right time to bail
  out on <A HREF="http://www.nbc.com/Deal_or_No_Deal/">Deal or No
  Deal</A>?
  An alternative: spend some time going
  through <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/Cartoon-Guide-Statistics-Larry-Gonick/dp/0062731025">The
  Cartoon Guide to Statistics</A>.  It's important to be able to
  understand basic concepts like conditional probability and
  independence, and basic statistical concepts like mean, variance,
  and the like.  
  <P>
  <li> Data structures and algorithms.  This is the theoretical
  counterpart to the practical knowledge you acquire when you learn to
  program and then practice a bunch.  If you do a lot of programming
  you may learn a lot of what you need to know about data structures
  and algorithms on the fly.  But this kind of course will also help
  you understand key ideas like computational complexity.
  <P> 
  <li>Basic calculus and linear algebra. To understand a lot of the work in computational modeling, some familiarity with these subjects is needed. That said, it's not like you need <em>all</em> of either subject, by a long shot. A very nice resource is Hal Daum&eacute;'s <A href="https://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/courses/2013S_ML/math4ml.pdf">Math for Machine Learning</A>. 
  <P>
  <li> Theory of grammars and automata -- particularly finite-state
  automata, finite-state transducers, and context-free grammars.  I'm
  particularly fond of how these are introduced in Lewis and
  Papadimitriou, <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Theory-Computation-Harry-Lewis/dp/0132624788/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1316633790&sr=1-1">Elements
  of the Theory of Computation</A>, though note that it's a rather
  rigorous and mathematical treatment of the subject.
  <P>
  <li> Machine learning.  It may seem odd that I'm listing this last, when so much of computational linguistics these days is driven by machine learning and particularly when deep learning approaches seem to be taking over the universe. But even if you're going to apply deep learning as a primary tool, it's essential that you understand the foundations behind it rather than applying it blindly. 
  </ul>
<P>
On the other side, if you've got computational background but you're new to language, some valuable courses to have include:
<ul>
<p><li>Introductory syntax. Even if you're not going to do work specifically related to syntax, one of the most important defining properties of human language is the fact that it conveys structured information in a sequential form.
<p><li>Experimental methods (e.g. in a psychology course).  This overlaps with the recommendation above to get some background in probability and statistics, but it's even better if you can get some background on human subject experimentation.
<p><li>Formal logic. This subject provides the foundation for understanding key elements of natural language semantics.
</ul>
<P>

<A name="chances">
<li> <strong>What are my chances of being admitted?</strong> <a href="#questions"><font size="tiny">[back to top]</font></a>
<P>
<strong>Please do not ask me this question.</strong>
From year to year, it is very difficult to say very far in advance whether or not I will even be taking new students, and unfortunately I cannot tell you your chances of being admitted.  This depends not
only on your background, but on many interacting details of the
admissions process within each department, including the other
applicants that year.  So <strong>please do not ask me your chances of being admitted or of my advising you</strong>, thanks.

<P>
This depends on your background and your goals.  These programs are
all quite competitive, so you'll want to apply to a department where
your background provides a good chance of being accepted.  Also think
about your goals.  If you're thinking about eventually going into
academia, what kind of department do you imagine yourself applying to?
During your grad school experience, you'll be taking a variety of
required and elective courses outside your research area -- do you
want to be a department where required coursework explores things like
semantics and phonology, or one where you'll be spending time on
things like databases and recursion theory?
<P>
If this is a question you're asking, it probably couldn't hurt you to 
look at this nice article on <A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rap/grads.html">choosing a
Ph.D. program in Computer Science</A>, which contains a lot of
information applicable to other disciplines, as well.

<P>
Generally if I have an open postdoc position, I'll advertise on the
CORPORA mailing list.  On the other hand, I'm always happy to hear
from people who are finishing up their Ph.D. if their research
interests are closely aligned with mine.  Send me some mail and tell
me about yourself.  Please include a current c.v.

<A name="visitors">
<li> <strong>Can I come to UMD as a visiting scholar?</strong> <a href="#questions"><font size="tiny">[back to top]</font></a>
<P>
<strong>Please do not e-mail me with this question.</strong> It does not matter if you are self-funded. I am unlikely to host visitors if I do not personally know them or their advisor.  The best way to approach this is by asking your advisor to introduce us.

<li> <strong>How can start getting up to speed on NLP via self-study?</strong> <a href="#questions"><font size="tiny">[back to top]</font></a>
<P>
If you're looking for traditional textbooks, the unquestionable standard is Jurafsky and Martin, now in its 3rd edition.  As of this writing it's publicly available for free on the Web as a <A HREF="https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/">pre-publication draft</A>.  There are lots of people who have done online lectures based on this book; it's not hard to find slide decks for the chapters done by various academics, via web search. 
<P>
If you want to watch lectures, I think Chris Manning's 
<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOhcuXMZkNm7j3fVwBBY42z">CS224N Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning</A> is brilliant. Note that lectures get updated periodically so it's worth looking for the most up-to-date lecture playlist for the course on YouTube by searching on the course title.
<P>
Having said the above, though, if you're interested in getting up to speed on NLP what I really recommend is structuring a hands-on effort around the <A HREF="https://www.nltk.org">Natural Language Toolkit</A>.  This is a python package that covers traditional NLP, but even more important, the package is tightly linked to a <A HREF="https://www.nltk.org/book/">NLTK Book</A> that introduces the basic concepts with python code that one can just copy/paste and then play around with.  It's also worth noting that the NLTK package/book combination is a good fit for someone who programs in some other language but needs an introduction to python focused on NLP.
In general one would not typically use NLTK in a serious production setting -- for that my go-to recommendation would be <A HREF="https://spacy.io">spaCy</A> -- but in terms of a great pedagogical combination of bare-minimum explanation and associated code, NLTK is the way to go if you want to get ramped up on the ideas, especially for someone who's interested in doing that in a very hands-on way.  One could then use Jurafsky and Martin as a textbook reference to look in more detail when NLTK's explanations are a little too sparse; conversely, once you understand the basics through NLTK, getting up to speed on doing things in spacy will be a lot easier. Note that NLTK is probably lighter than one might want on the most recent deep learning approaches, but if you've got Jurafsky and Martin for the core ideas and Manning's lectures for detailed and more up to date discussion then I think you've got pretty much everything you need.
