<h2>Arranging meetings with me</h2>

My calendar is a bit of a hodge-podge of meetings at different locations (since I have offices both in Linguistics and at UMIACS), remote discussions (Zoom or Google Hangout), and phone calls.
<P>
People on campus: you should <em>not</em> trust information they find in my campus calendar, because it does not include conflicts on my personal calendar.
<P>
If you'd like to meet with me, please use the email template below; in particular, having two or three days/times would be helpful.

Subject: Meeting about &LT;TOPIC&GT;

Hi!  I'd like to meet with you to talk about &LT;WHAT THE MEETING IS ABOUT&GT;.

Some days and time windows I can meet, in order of preference, are: 
<ul>
<li> &LT;DATE&GT;, between &LT;START TIME&GT; and &LT;END TIME&GT;
<li> &LT;DATE&GT;, between &LT;START TIME&GT; and &LT;END TIME&GT;
<li> &LT;DATE&GT;, between &LT;START TIME&GT; and &LT;END TIME&GT;
</ul>

I'd prefer to meet in person if possible. / Meeting remotely is fine.

Thanks,

   &LT;NAME&GT;
