<h2>Philip Resnik's research in computational political science</h2>

Computational political science is emerging as an incredibly
interesting research area, one that shares the momentum that's
building in <A
 HREF="http://gking.harvard.edu/files/LazPenAda09.pdf">computational
social science</A> more generally.  I've been finding myself involved
in a number of <A HREF="#media">public conversations</A> about this
topic, and in my work I've been focusing on three main things:
    <ul>
      <li>    <A HREF="#reactlabs">real-time polling</A>,
      <li>    <A HREF="#influence">computational modeling of influence</A>,
      <li>    <A HREF="#sentiment">sentiment analysis and framing</A>.
    </ul

<h3>React Labs: real-time polling</h3>

One of the big challenges facing data-driven work in political science
is gathering good data.  <A HREF="#sentiment">Analyzing Twitter</A>
is all well and good, but it has significant disadvantages, too.  What
you'd really like is something that combines the control you get in
focus groups or polls (particularly the ability to focus on particular
questions) with the large-scale, instantaneous reactions of social
media populations.
<P>
I started the <A HREF="http://reactlabs.org">React Labs</A> project
to create just that.
<P>
      In collaboration with political scientist <A
 HREF="http://psfaculty.ucdavis.edu/boydstun/Boydstun/Home.html">Amber
Boydston</A> (UC Davis) and user experience designer <A
 HREF="http://jeffreykorn.com/">Jeffrey Korn</A>, I've been developing
an app that lets people watch live events like political debates and
speeches and react to them using their smartphones in real
time. During the event, live charting is updated second by second to
provide a dynamic picture of people's reactions.  The ambition is
essentially to put a more sophisticated kind of
<A HREF="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/media_entertainment/dial-panel-weighs-in-on-palin-and-biden-debate/">Nielsen dial</A> in the
hands of every smartphone user in the country.  It can also
be used in more controlled settings -- for example, enabling the
audience to provide real-time feedback to a speaker. (Yes, I plan
to try this out during one of my own lectures very soon.)

<h3>Computational modeling of influence</h3>

Who has control of the agenda in a political conversation, and what do
they do with it?  Clearly if someone has the role of moderator, they
exercise some control over what gets talked about.  But how strong is
that control?  And can we detect and measure objectively when somebody
takes control over the agenda in a conversation?

Colleague <A HREF="http://umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/">Jordan
 Boyd-Graber</A>, grad student <A
  HREF="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~vietan/">Viet-An Nguyen</A>, and I have
 been developing computational models that analyze a conversation like
 a political debate or an episode of <em>Crossfire</em>, and automatically identify both the
 <em>topics</em> under discussion and the degree of <em>topic
 control</em> that participants are exercising.
<P>

As an example, the automatic analysis of the Biden-Palin debate in
2008 identifies that Gwen Ifill, the moderator, was the person controlling
the topic most of the time (long gray bars in the "Shift" column), but
it also automatically uncovers situations like turn 48 of in debate
transcript, where Palin responded to a question about the mortgage crisis by
talking about energy policy.
<P>
<div style="height:500px border:1px solid blue; padding:5px;">
<img height=500 src="biden_palin.png" alt="Topic control example" border:1px solid blue; float:left; />
</div>
<P>
Interestingly, if you look at the degree of topic control by all participants in the four 2008 presidential debates,
you find that Palin had the strongest propensity among all the candidates to exert control over the topic being discussed,
and you also find objective empirical support for the widespread perception that Ifill was a <A HREF="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2008/10/your-vp-debate-wrapup-in-four-bullet-points/8887/">weak moderator</A>.  (Compare Biden and Palin to Ifill, below, then compare McCain and Obama to their moderators.)

<h3>Sentiment analysis and framing</h3>

In their important 2008 <A
         HREF="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/llee/omsa/omsa.pdf">book</A>
        on the topic, Bo Pang and Lillian Lee pointed out that there
        was a "land rush" starting in the area of sentiment analysis.
        Today it's easy to find companies tracking sentiment about
        brands and products in social media for business
        purposes. (Outside of academia I'm lead scientist for one of
        them, <A HREF="http://converseon.com">Converseon</A>.)  The
        political world has caught on, as well, with lots of people <A
         HREF="http://www.washingtonpost.com/mention-machine">tracking
        mentions</A> of political candidates and some even <A
         HREF="http://mashable.com/2012/01/03/washington-post-twitter-elections/">suggesting</A>
        that automatic analysis of opinions on Twitter could be better
        than traditional polling.  I have talked about the use of
        sentiment analysis in political contexts, and some of the issues and hype
        surrounding it, in some recent <A HREF="#media">public
        discussions</A>.

<P> In my current research, I'm less focused on straight
positive-versus-negative sentiment analysis (though sentiment analysis
for <A
 HREF="http://umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/docs/jbg-mlslda-2010.pdf">other
languages</A> remains an active topic).  What's really got me excited
is the idea of applying the same sorts of computational ideas to
the related topic of <em>framing</em> -- that is, how the language we use can encourage
taking a particular, often positive or negative, perspective on an
issue.  (When this is done deliberately in political discourse,
particularly by someone we disagree with, we often call it <A
 HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(public_relations)">spin</A>.)
<P>
Framing is a subject that has received relatively little attention from a computational perspective.
My student Stephan Greene did a nice <A HREF="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~sgreene/SGreeneDissertationFinalDist.pdf">dissertation</A> laying the foundations for a linguistically well founded approach to framing, focusing on the way that grammatical choices encourage particular interpretations, which we summarized in a 2009 <A HREF="http://umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/pubs/greene_resnik_naacl2009.pdf">paper</A>.  (When my three-year-old says "Daddy, my toy broke" to de-emphasize his own role in what happened, he's exploiting the same linguistic strategy Ronald Reagan did when he famously said "Mistakes were made".)  In current work, colleagues and I are starting to develop computational models of this <em>syntactic framing</em> phenomenon, as well as <em>lexical framing</em> (e.g. the choice of whether to say <em>death tax</em> or <em>estate tax</em>), and models that treat framing as an <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenda-setting_theory#Framing_and_Second-level_Agenda_setting:_Similarities.2C_Differences.2C_and_Controversies">extension of agenda-setting</A>.
