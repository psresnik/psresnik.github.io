<H1>Why work on Machine Translation?</H1>

A potential applicant to the Linguistics graduate program wrote me the

Here's what I replied:
<pre>
Translation of literature is indeed likely to be a very difficult
problem.  However, translation of literal text, such as news wire, has
made significant progress in the last 15-20 years thanks to the
introduction of large scale statistical methods.  Briefly, text that
has been translated by people is an enormous natural resource.  To
consider an analogy, one might have imagined that just creating a
bilingual dictionary would have some of the same problems you mention,
and yet large bilingual dictionaries of fairly high reliability can be
extracted by looking statistically at how words are used when human
beings have created translations from one language into another.  More
to the point, I consider myself at least as much a scientist as an
engineer: for me, the goal is understand how language works, not just
to build things.  I believe we can learn a great deal about language,
and about ourselves as human beings, from working on translation --
even if the problem is not completely solved.

Or perhaps I'm just an optimist. :-)
