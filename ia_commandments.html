The N Commandments for using the Internet Archive
</H1>

Our group has 
<A HREF="http://www.archive.org/web/researcher/proposal.php">
researcher access</A> to the <A HREF="http://www.archive.org">Internet
Archive</A>, which permits us to work on the Archive's cluster.
<P>
Over the past several years, we have evolved some rules of good
citizenship that help to avoid problematic situations,
e.g. accidentally taking over a large chunk of the internal bandwidth
on their network.  This Web page attempts to institutionalize some of
that knowledge.  It's titled "The N Commandments" because, like the
Archive itself, the list is likely to need updating.

<OL>
 <LI>  Be sure not to run a big job before you've learned how to monitor and 
   kill it
 <LI>  Avoid running processes on homeserver (an automatic check in the 
   scripts might be useful)
 <LI>  Avoid jobs that have multiple hosts read or write large amounts of data 
   to /home (use /tmp/your_username directories instead)
 <LI>  Avoid heavy I/O activity on /home in general
 <LI>  Be careful not to run one p2 job inside another (an automatic check 
   in the scripts might be useful)
 <LI> When you use ctrl-C to kill a p2 job, it leaves pipe files in
   the /tmp (or /tmp/your_username?) directory (extension .p2tmp), and 
   if you kill a sort process,
   it may leave behind a temporary file there.  Please check to clean
   these up once in a while.
 <LI>  Be careful about exceeding disk quota on any of the disks at run time
 <LI>  Be sure to nice your processes
 <LI>  Be sure not to leave any processes running invadvertently (check the 
   hosts you've been working with before logging off)
 <LI>  Be sure to clean up the files you've placed 
       in /tmp/your_username directories on all hosts (particularly large files)
 <LI>  For the sake of your own sanity, if a job seems to be running forever, 
  check to see if an I/O or ssh breakdown on some host isn't holding it back
