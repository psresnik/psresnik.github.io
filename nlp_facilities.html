<H1>UMD NLP Lab Computing Facilties</H1>

A brief rundown on current NLP laboratory hardware at UMD.  This is
not CS or UMIACS, but just our NLP labs alone --- CLIP and LAMP.  For
more on NLP resources (not exhaustive, and organized mostly for
lab-internal use) see the Lab pages (especially the Resources link) at
