<h1>What did you do to your hand?</h1>

<em>February 2008</em>
<P>

Well, here's the responsible party:

That's Annie, our sweet but very big and very dumb dog.
<P>
Annie had just concluded stealing a snack from my toddler, Harry.  I
made a grab for her collar, and at the last second she changed
direction.  I'm not sure exactly how it happened, but I must have
jammed my finger just the right way on her collar, shoulder, or
perhaps her very thick, furry skull.
<P>
I didn't notice it at the time, but a few minutes later I
realized my finger hurt, and I discovered, most unpleasantly, that
part of it was now bending in the wrong direction.  Ouch!
<P>
Result (after some X-rays): in my right ring finger, the bone closest
to the tip had literally snapped.  The X-ray looks something like this:

                       xxxxxxxxxOOOxxxxxxxxx...[rest of finger]
                      ^          ^

                      |          |
                  break      last knuckle

Looks like I'll be in a splint until late March and we'll see how
things go from there.

Incidentally, one of the results of this experience is that I've
discovered a cool service called <A href="http://jott.com">Jott</A>,
which uses speech recognition (plus a big call center of human
transcribers in India for quality assurance) to allow you to phone in
a message up to 30 seconds long and have the text e-mailed to your
intended recipient.
