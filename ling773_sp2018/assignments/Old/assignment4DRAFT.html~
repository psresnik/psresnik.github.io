<ul>
<li> <strong>Problem 1.</strong>  Do  <A HREF="hmm_sp2014.html">this Using a Hidden Markov Model exercise</A>.  Before we talk about HMM training and decoding next week this will give you a chance to get a hands-on feel for how HMMs and EM are to use in a purely unsupervised setting, i.e. with no annotated data. No programming is required, although, as it says in the exercise instructions, you're also welcome to dig deeper if you'd like. The more thought and time you spend, the more you'll get out of it. And don't forget that what we get to grade is the writeup, so take the time to make it good.
<P>
<li> <strong>Problem 2.</strong> Read <A HREF="http://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html">Deep Learning with PyTorch: A 60 Minute Blitz</A>. If you were not already familiar with numpy, also read through <A HREF="http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/">this numpy tutorial</A> or <A HREF="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/quickstart.html">this numpy quickstart tutorial</A>. If you need to review neural networks more generally, read 

<A HREF="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html">Chapter 1</A> and
<A HREF="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html">Chapter 2</A> 

This is only a reading assignment and you are not required to actually do anything in terms of programming, but if you have limited experience with python and/or with neural networks, you are encouraged to actually work through the tutorials running the python examples. 
<P>
As an alternative, read/work through Joe Barrow's intro PyTorch materials, starting with his <A HREF="https://github.com/jbarrow/pytorch-reading-group">overview and setup</A>
and then going on to 
<A HREF="https://github.com/jbarrow/pytorch-reading-group/blob/master/1_Feedforward_Networks/Assignment.ipynb">his working-through of feed-forward networks</A>.
<P>
In your writeup, simply write a few sentences to a paragraph describing what you did. 
<P>
