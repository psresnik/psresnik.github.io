<P>
<HR>

<ul>
<li> <strong>Part 1.</strong>  Do  <A HREF="hmm_sp2018.html">this Using a Hidden Markov Model exercise</A>.  This will give you a chance to get a hands-on feel for how HMMs and EM are to use in a purely unsupervised setting, i.e. with no annotated data. No programming is required, although, as it says in the exercise instructions, you're also welcome to dig deeper if you'd like. The more thought and time you spend, the more you'll get out of it. And don't forget that what we get to grade is the writeup, so take the time to make it good.
<P>
Note that you are welcome to help each other out with compilation, sharing executables, etc. Getting the code to run is not supposed to be the interesting part of the assignment. Though if you do benefit from someone's help, please make sure to acknowledge them in your writeup and/or on Piazza.
<P>
<li> <strong>Part 2.</strong> <em>This part is only a reading assignment and you are not required to actually do anything in terms of programming. However, if you have little experience with python and/or with neural networks, you are encouraged to actually work through the relevant tutorials running the python examples. </em>
<P>
  Read <A HREF="http://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html">Deep Learning with PyTorch: A 60 Minute Blitz</A>. 
<P>
Optionally, you might also want to read/work through Joe Barrow's intro PyTorch materials, starting with his <A HREF="https://github.com/jbarrow/pytorch-reading-group">overview and setup</A>
and then going on to <A HREF="https://github.com/jbarrow/pytorch-reading-group/blob/master/1_Feedforward_Networks/Assignment.ipynb">his working-through of feed-forward networks</A>.
<P>
As another optional reading after the 60 Minute Blitz you might want to look at <A HREF="http://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/pytorch_with_examples.html">PyTorch with examples</A>, which provides
a good comparison among the pros and cons of numpy/tensorflow/pytorch and is also useful for understanding PyTorch more generally. 
<P>
If you were not already familiar with numpy, you may first want to read through <A HREF="http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/">this numpy tutorial</A> 
         or <A HREF="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/quickstart.html">this numpy quickstart tutorial</A>. 
<P>
  If you need to review neural networks more generally, read 
    <A HREF="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html">Chapter 1</A> and
    <A HREF="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html">Chapter 2</A> of 
   Nielsen, <A HREF="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/">Neural Networks and Deep Learning</A>.

<P>
<strong>In your writeup, simply write a few sentences to a paragraph describing what you read and your reactions to it.</strong>
<P>

<h3>Extra credit</h3>

<em>Value: up to 10% of a full homework assignment</em>
<P>
Last week you had a choice between two exercises in programming and data exploration, options 3a and 3b. For extra credit, do the option you did <em>not</em> choose last week.

</ul>
