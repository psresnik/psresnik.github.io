<h1>Helpful hints for LDA assignment</h1>

If you are using a system that doesn't have wget and you don't want to install it, you most likely can download datasets by using curl, e.g.:
<pre>
curl -O http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/aclImdb_v1.tar.gz
</pre>
<P>
As another alternative:

<ol>
<li>
Go to this website: http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/ and click on Large Movie Review Dataset v1.0.
Download that to:
<PRE>
YOUR/PATH/TO/word2vec_assignment/data/
</PRE>
YOUR/PATH/TO is the path to the directory you git-cloned.

<li>
extract it with the tool of your choice.

<li>
Delete aclImdb_v1.tar.gz to save space.

<li> 
Make sure that 
YOUR/PATH/TO/word2vec_assignment/data/aclImdb/
contains the data. You should see:
<pre> 
README
imdb.vocab
imdbEr.txt
test/
train/
</pre>
in that directory
