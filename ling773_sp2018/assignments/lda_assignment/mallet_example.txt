# INSTALL MALLET
# E.g., git clone https://github.com/mimno/Mallet.git

# Below we assume shell variable M is the path to mallet bin directory:
#  % echo $M
#  /Users/resnik/misc/pkg/mallet/mallet-git/Mallet/bin

# CREATE OUTPUT DIR
mkdir ./workdir

# IMPORT DOCUMENTS INTO MALLET
#
# Parameters of interest:
# --remove-stopwords [TRUE|FALSE]
# --extra-stopwords FILE
#  Read whitespace-separated words from this file, and add them to the list of words to ignore.
# --gram-sizes INTEGER,[INTEGER,...]
#  Include among the features all n-grams of sizes specified.  For
#  example, to get all unigrams and bigrams, use --gram-sizes 1,2.
#  This option occurs after the removal of stop words, if removed.
# --keep-sequence [TRUE|FALSE]
#   If true, final data will be a FeatureSequence rather than a FeatureVector.
# --keep-sequence-bigrams [TRUE|FALSE]
#  If true, final data will be a FeatureSequenceWithBigrams rather than a FeatureVector.

# Import document files for building topic model
# This version uses unigram features

# TRAIN LDA TOPIC MODEL
#
# Parameters of interest:
# --testing FILENAME
#   The filename from which to read the list of instances for empirical
#   likelihood calculation.  Use - for stdin.  The instances must be
#   FeatureSequence or FeatureSequenceWithBigrams, not FeatureVector
# --doc-topics-threshold DECIMAL
#   When writing topic proportions per document with --output-doc-topics, do not 
#   print topics with proportions less than this threshold value.
#   Default is 0.0
# --use-ngrams true|false
#   Rather than using LDA, use Topical-N-Grams, which models phrases.
#   Default is false
# --num-iterations INTEGER
# Use --optimize-interval 50 rather than default for better topics
